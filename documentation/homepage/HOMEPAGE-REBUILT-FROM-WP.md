I extracted the **exact homepage structure** from your WordPress database and rebuilt it with:

### ✅ All Sections Matching divorcelawyer.com

2. **Discover Slider** - 4 icon cards with images
3. **Top Lawyers** - Location-based with vetting process
4. **Most Popular Reads** - Article grid
5. **Stages of Divorce** - 6 stages
6. **Emotional Path** - 6 emotions  
7. **Real Voices: Coffee Talk** - Testimonials
8. **Get Informed Categories** - 7 category cards
9. **Connect with Lawyer** - CTA section
10. **Common Questions** - FAQ accordion
11. **Newsletter Signup**

### ✅ All Images Added
