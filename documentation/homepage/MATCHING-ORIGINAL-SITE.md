# 📋 Information Needed to Match DivorceLawyer.com Exactly

I found the WordPress theme with all styling! Here's what I need from you to replicate the site exactly:

## ✅ What I Already Have

I found the WordPress theme at:
`site-archive-divorcelaw2stg-live-1763759542-d2QosSxv7qDLu0wpGk92rY6wsRNttpLJMFXX/wp-content/themes/wp-divorcelawyers/`

This includes:
- ✅ **Tailwind config** with all custom colors
- ✅ **All SCSS/CSS styles** for components
- ✅ **All PHP block components** (SearchHero, HeroComponent, etc.)
- ✅ **All Blade templates** (views)
- ✅ **Custom fonts** (Proxima, Libre, DMSans, etc.)
- ✅ **Color palette** (primary: #FC9445 orange, bg: #18414D bluish, etc.)

## 🎨 Color Scheme (from Tailwind config)

**Primary Colors:**
- Primary Orange: `#FC9445`
- Bluish (backgrounds): `#163B46`, `#18414D`, `#18434E`
- Dark text: `#000000`
- Light backgrounds: `#FAFAFA`, `#F5F1ED`

## 📸 What I Need From You

### 1. **Homepage Screenshots** (CRITICAL)
Please provide screenshots of the live site homepage:
- Full page scroll capture of https://divorcelawyer.com
- Or individual screenshots of each section:
  - Hero section
  - Any cards/features below hero
  - Content sections
  - Footer

### 2. **Key Page Screenshots**
- State page example (e.g., /texas/)
- City page example (e.g., /texas/houston/)
- Article detail page (any article)
- Lawyer profile page (if different from what I can see)

### 3. **Confirm Homepage URL Structure**
What's currently on the homepage? Is it:
- A search hero with background image?
- List of states?
- Featured content?
- Mix of sections?

## 🛠️ What I'll Do

Once I have the screenshots, I will:

1. **Extract exact layout** from the screenshots
2. **Convert WordPress blocks to Next.js components** using the existing:
   - Blade templates (for structure)
   - SCSS files (for styling)
   - PHP blocks (for data structure)
3. **Copy Tailwind config** exactly (colors, fonts, spacing)
4. **Replicate every detail** (borders, shadows, hover states, animations)
5. **Match typography** exactly (font sizes, weights, line heights)
6. **Port all fonts** to Next.js

## 📁 Files I Can Reference

I have access to all these WordPress theme files:
- `/resources/views/blocks/` - All block templates
- `/resources/Blocks/*/index.scss` - All component styles
- `/resources/styles/` - Global styles
- `/tailwind.config.js` - Complete design system
- `/public/fonts/` - All font files
- `/resources/images/` - Icons and assets

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **You**: Provide screenshots of divorcelawyer.com homepage
2. **Me**: Convert the WordPress theme to Next.js exactly as it appears
3. **You**: Review and provide feedback
4. **Me**: Iterate until perfect match

## 💡 Alternative: Direct Access

If you prefer, you could also:
- Give me access to the live WordPress site backend (I can see exactly what blocks are on each page)
- Or export a specific page as HTML so I can see the exact structure
- Or simply describe which sections appear on the homepage in order

## ❓ Questions for You

1. Do you have screenshots of the homepage ready?
2. Should I start with homepage first, then move to other pages?
3. Are there any specific pages/sections that are highest priority?
4. Any features or interactions I should pay special attention to?

**I'm ready to build an exact replica once I see the homepage!** 🎯
