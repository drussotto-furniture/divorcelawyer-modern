# Cursor Chat History

This folder contains automatically saved chat conversations from Cursor.

## Rule

**All Cursor chat conversations must be automatically saved as markdown files in this folder.**

## File Naming Convention

- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- Description should be a brief summary of the main topic discussed
- Example: `2025-01-27-chat-history-request.md`

## File Structure

Each saved conversation should include:
- Date and title header
- Conversation summary
- Full conversation with user queries and assistant responses
- Any relevant code snippets or file references
- Actions taken during the conversation

## Automatic Saving

This rule is active for all future conversations. The assistant should save conversations automatically at the end of each session without requiring user prompts.
