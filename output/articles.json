Abusive, manipulative, controlling. I wanted him as far away from me and our children as possible. I had no problem accepting child support for the two children who were still underage and living at home, so why did I struggle with accepting alimony? I didn’t want anything of his, and I saw his paycheck as just that: his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-13287 size-full\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/I_Wish_I_Had_Taken_Alimony.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022\\u0022 width=\\u0022600\\u0022 height=\\u0022452\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nIn retrospect, I wish I had taken it. I spent 22 years keeping our home, raising our children, and managing our finances. I contributed financially through a seasonal job, but my core role was homemaker. At the time, I couldn’t see the truth that it wasn’t his at all. Everything we owned, including the foundation that we created for him to continue to receive an ongoing and increasing paycheck was indeed ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, we made it through. I stood on my own, with my pride intact, but it would have been so much easier with alimony. I worked two jobs, but I kept the car and the house. It took about two years to feel financially stable again, and much longer to thrive. During that time, I spent more energy working than parenting, and I probably missed the mark.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eIf I were talking to my younger self, I'd say: take the money,it's yours\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eStarting Over\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWithout alimony, my number one focus became survival. I had a small savings account, which was an inheritance from my late parents. What I would have given to have had my father there instead. Alas, this was my bridge to the future. The rest was up to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was nearly 40 and entering the workforce in a real way for the first time in my life. I was terrified. I lacked formal education because I was in high school when our first child was born, and I hadn’t pursued it further. Thankfully, I held a seasonal role as a tax accountant for a few years, so I wasn’t exactly starting from scratch, but it felt like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I am smart and scrappy, aside from seasonal work, my resume only included life experience: I ran a household of five, managed the family finances, led Girl Scout troops, Boy Scout dens and baseball clubs, coordinated carpools for kids at three different schools, was active in the PTA and Band Boosters, and served as an executor of my parents will. While it may be true that these engagements created transferable skills, I had very little to show in the way of professional on-the-job experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, I landed an office job making minimum wage – $7.25 an hour. It was my first foray into the 9 to 5 world. I quickly learned to navigate office politics, after-hours social events, and the demands of climbing the corporate ladder. Between the job and the commute, it consumed me. Parenting took a back seat at a time when my teenage children needed me the most.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a few years, I was promoted, fired, and then hired by a competitor. This time, my job took me to a new state. I left my old life behind. By the time I reached retirement, I had made it to the upper echelons of management. I did it, but it was a hard road.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eTrue Colors\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nI didn’t listen to my attorney about alimony when he tried to help me see that I deserved to have a solid foundation for a fresh start, and I should have. He did convince me, though, that I deserved something. He convinced me to add a clause in the divorce papers entitling me to a percentage of my ex-husband’s retirement. He pointed out that by the time I retired, my years in the workforce would be significantly shorter than if I had worked all along, and that my consequently smaller retirement draw alone would not be enough to sustain me. I appreciated that advice down the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should not have been a surprise, but when it was finally time to start paying me a portion of his retirement, my ex asked me to give up the money so that he could leave it to his current wife. I was older and wiser by then, and had spent all of those years making it on my own. Thanks to my attorney, the divorce papers were clear. Even though he had remarried several times, I was still entitled to this money. Giving it up was a hard pass, and I readily cashed in.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eRoad Less Traveled\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen I look back, I think about the road less traveled. What if I had just taken alimony? Maybe I would have taken the same job or maybe I would have worked part-time and spent more of my energy supporting my teenage kids. Maybe I would have worried less, struggled less. Maybe my son would have been a different parent to his own children, which he had young. Maybe I wouldn’t have moved away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, it’s hard to know which decisions would have been different. We made it, but it didn’t have to be that hard. By design, alimony might have created a more equitable financial future for me. Afterall, we built that life together, and the decisions we made affected my ability to generate income for the years that followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had to do it all over again, I would listen to my attorney and lean into more aggressive financial planning. But divorce is not a practical exercise. It is fraught with emotion. I had completely lost trust in everything I knew to be true and my emotions, my pride, led me to make bold decisions that shaped my financial future for years to come. Rather than making him pay, I let him off the hook.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had to do it again, I would put me first. If I were talking to my younger self, I’d say: take the money, it’s yours\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Coffee Talk\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"Cofee\",\"url\":\"https://www.divorcelawyer.com/learning-center/real-voices/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":1,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"4\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

But it was college and I was sure it would get better. It didn’t. We had a baby. Surely once he saw how much our daughter needed him he would stop. He didn’t. He didn’t stop with the birth of our second child. He didn’t stop with his father dying of alcoholism. Not only did he drink, but he drank angry. He would seethe and blame and scream and, inevitably, pass out. When he woke up, he would try to clean up his mess, both literally and figuratively. He would apologize and cry and promise it was the last time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was never the last time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-13293 size-full\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Addiction_It_was_Never_the_Last_Time.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Addiction: It was Never the Last Time\\u0022 width=\\u0022600\\u0022 height=\\u0022400\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, he would stop. But not for long. Just long enough for me to exhale and convince myself that he was better. When he started up again, it would blindside me every time. Whether it was finding him passed out on the couch, or finding empty booze bottles hidden with the Christmas decorations. It would hit me like a punch in the stomach. I would try, once again, to convince myself that it wasn’t that bad. That it wasn’t going to affect our family like it had before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a vicious cycle, and it only got worse.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e20 years. That's how long it took me to say: enough\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\nEven though there were incredibly dark days, it was never quite far enough. I convinced myself that if it ever went just one step further, I would finally leave. When he passed out in our daughter’s bed, I rationalized staying because she was asleep and didn’t wake up. I told myself that if she had woken up and seen him, that would have been enough to leave. When he drove drunk with our children in the car, I justified staying because they didn’t get into an accident. If they had crashed, that would have been enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly, there was a point when I wasn’t sure what it would take for me to stop making excuses. And then the day came.\\r\\n\\r\\n20 years. That’s how long it took for me to say, “enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t wake up that morning knowing I was going to leave. I was fixing my daughter a sandwich and he stood in the doorway calling me names. “Fat, ugly, stupid, worthless…” I ignored him. I was good at that. But my daughter didn’t. She yelled out, “stop, Daddy – you promised!!” He looked at her and said, “I won’t stop. Because you and your sister need to know what a horrible person your mother is.” I watched her cry, knowing that if I opened my mouth, it would only make things worse. That this would only continue, on and on, forever and ever. When he finally walked away, I said to my daughters, “Girls, go get into the car.” I quietly followed them, my heart thumping in my chest. We drove to my mother’s house while I tried to figure out my next steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the day that I decided to change my life. When I told him I wanted a divorce, he cried and screamed and said I couldn’t have one. He spewed more hateful things at me in front of our children and then begged again and again for me to reconsider.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here’s the thing. He is sick and needs help, and so do I. And we weren’t going to get that help together. While an outsider could see that this marriage was doomed from the start, we couldn’t. Eventually, my girls and I ended up at a hotel. It wasn’t until I left him that I could see that I didn't recognize him anymore. I didn’t trust him. And I didn’t love the person he had become.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt definitely got harder before it got easier. He became obsessive. He sent more than 6,500 text messages over the 8 weeks that followed. When he drank, he went on emotionally and verbally abusive tirades. He would threaten to take our children and leave me penniless. That I was delusional if I thought a judge would side with me. He would call 15 times a day – I never answered. We weren’t living together, but he made sure I knew he was still around.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our first court case, my attorney presented the text messages to the judge. The judge filed a motion that not only required him to take combative parenting classes, but also stated that he was no longer allowed to text me. I didn’t know that was an option. From that point forward, he could only use a monitored legal app for communication. It also has a ‘tone detector’ so he can’t be verbally abusive. Now, I am able to get through my days without wondering how his addiction is going to ruin everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not perfect, but it’s a start.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Coffee Talk\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"Real Voices\",\"url\":\"https://www.divorcelawyer.com/learning-center/real-voices/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":1,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Once you’ve decided to move forward, it is helpful to have a map that outlines the journey so that you will know what to expect. Though each situation is unique and can be impacted by your state’s laws, here are 10 common steps to divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14560 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://one8divorc1dev.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/10_Steps_to_Divorce-1024x576.png\\u0022 alt=\\u002210 Steps to Divorce\\u0022 width=\\u0022752\\u0022 height=\\u0022423\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e1. Pre-filing Preparations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAs you prepare to start divorce proceedings, you will want to ready yourself and gather your team. Divorce ranks as one of the most stressful potential life events we can experience. It can be costly, take up a lot of time, and can be painful for you and those you hold dear. It helps to have a strong support system in place from the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo start, think about your situation and those around you who may be affected. It might be useful to seek a therapist or mentor during this period who can help you cope with emotions that will arise along the way. This is also a good time to start \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://one8divorc1dev.wpenginepowered.com/lawyer/marvin-solomiany/\\u0022\\u003eresearching lawyers\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://one8divorc1dev.wpenginepowered.com/learning-center/real-voices/\\u0022\\u003elearning from others\\u003c/a\\u003e who have been there to better understand the experience.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e2. Filing For A Divorce\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe legal process officially begins when a complaint is filed in the county where you reside as a couple. While this can be done by either spouse without an attorney, many opt for legal counsel to help ensure that the paperwork is filled out correctly and that it best reflects their interests.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e3. Serving the Papers\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOnce the paperwork has been processed, it must be officially served to the other partner. Upon receipt, the mandatory waiting period imposed by the court will be initiated. Papers can be served by a sheriff, process server, or personal delivery.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e4. Response to the Complaint\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOn average, the other party will have 20 to 30 days to respond to the divorce papers by contesting or agreeing. The length of time varies by state. In Georgia, it’s 30 days, while Texas requires you to respond by 10am on the Monday following the 20th day. If they do not respond formally, getting a judge to agree to a default divorce may be possible. Your local and state statutes will determine the time to respond, so it is important to consult an attorney for the most relevant information.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e5. Discovery\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn this phase, both parties exchange information, financial documents, and anything pertinent to the proceedings. Your lawyers will often handle this.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThings can be more or less complicated than you expect.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e6. Mediations and Negotiations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCourts often encourage parties to work out as many issues as possible outside official proceedings. Agreeing with your soon-to-be former spouse can save you considerable time and money, and leave the courts free to handle other cases. When dissension persists, a mediator can arbitrate negotiations and help you and the other party come to an agreement. This can take several weeks or even months, depending on how severe the disagreements are and how committed both parties are to settling out of court.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e7. Temporary Orders\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCourts may opt to impose certain obligations on both parties during pre-trial arbitration. This most often comes into play when custody of children is involved, and they need legal protections to ensure they have a safe and stable home.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e8. Trial or Final Hearing\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen attempts to reach an agreement fail, both parties will appear before a judge. This process can vary quite a bit in length. The legal proceedings themselves could take hours and, if the court is busy with a backlog of cases, it could take weeks or months before you can set a date. The delays can also add up if either party doesn’t show, which can push things until a rescheduled date can be set.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e9. Issuance of Final Judgment\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOnce the disputes have been settled, there will be a final hearing, during which the judge will finalize the divorce and lay out specific terms. The time needed to get a final hearing may vary based on the backlog of cases, the specific judge in charge of the proceedings, and the location where everything occurs.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e10. Post-Decree Actions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nEven when the divorce is finalized, follow-up actions may still be needed. This is particularly true if a large estate is being divided or children are involved. Custody negotiations can last for years and can be adjusted over time in response to life circumstances, such as moving to a new state. Dividing property may require selling it and using an agreed-upon method to distribute the funds.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eYour Roadmap\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nEach situation is unique. As you prepare for the divorce process, it is important to know that things can be more or less complicated than you expect.

Consult a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/connect-with-lawyer/\\u0022\\u003eDivorceLawyer.Com law firm member\\u003c/a\\u003e who can provide guidance based on your unique circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14563 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/How_Long_Does_Divorce_Typically_Take.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022How long does divorce tipically take\\u0022 width=\\u0022843\\u0022 height=\\u0022562\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nThe divorce timeline is different for everyone. You can move through the process in as little as 31 days when all parties agree or, if there are differences that need to be arbitrated, it can last for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some common timelines.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e31 Days\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nJust over a month is generally the shortest time it will take to get a divorce. Even if everything is in order and everyone agrees to the terms, many states have mandatory “waiting” or “cooling off” periods immediately after you file. Usually, you won’t have to take any action during that period, but you cannot move forward until this time has passed. The waiting period is 30 days in some states and can be as long as 365 days in others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock starts ticking the moment that the divorce papers are served to your spouse, not when you file them in court. After any applicable waiting period, a judge can review the case and give final approval.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eDivorce comes in many shapes and sizes, often taking anywhere from a month to a year or more.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e45 - 60 days\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSix to eight weeks is how long an uncontested divorce typically takes. If you and your soon-to-be former spouse can agree on the details of your separation, then the court just has to rubber-stamp everything to make it official. There can be some delays due to the time required to file paperwork and handle any incidental matters that may arise based on your state.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e6 - 12 months\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe time for a contested divorce can vary, but it usually takes 6 - 12 months to settle all disputes, get a judgment, and process the paperwork. If children are involved and there is a custody struggle, it can take much longer and may end up being revisited by the court every few years.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eDelays\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDelays can happen for various reasons along the way and can be frustrating when you just want to move forward. Some judges have a lot of cases they are managing, which can create a backlog in scheduling. If you opt to go it alone without an attorney and your divorce stalls for several months, you may want to revisit this strategy. Hiring a lawyer who is familiar with how to best navigate the system in your county can be helpful when working with the clerks to finalize everything more quickly.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eDivorce by Publication\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf your spouse cannot be found, and reasonable efforts have been made to contact them, a divorce by publication is possible. This involves a formal notice published in a “paper of repute” that states that the marriage is dissolved. Approval by a judge is required beforehand, and the notice must run for the amount of time specified by your state’s laws, which can be multiple weeks.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSilent Divorce\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSome couples separate without filing legal paperwork to formalize the divorce. The two are still legally married in these cases, but the emotional and physical connection has been severed. This is often done when children are involved to make things less complicated. Sometimes, the two will even continue living together for convenience's sake.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it works for some, a silent divorce technically has no end and comes with some legal risks. At any point, either spouse can initiate formal proceedings. Even if you have an amicable relationship and are ending on good terms, consulting an attorney may be worth it to ensure you know your rights and liabilities.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce comes in many shapes and sizes, often taking anywhere from a month to a year or more. It’s really about finding the best fit for you and your family, and understanding how your state and local laws might impact the process. Consult a legal professional to explore the best approach for your divorce and get answers to your questions based on your unique situation.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

You might be embarrassed, ashamed, or feel like you failed at something. That’s only natural, but it’s important to understand those feelings and work through them towards a brighter future. One way to start moving forward is to talk to your friends about what you are going through and open yourself up to accepting their support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14574 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/How_to_Tell_Your_Friends_that_You_Are-Getting_Divorced.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022How to Tell Your Friends that You Are Getting Divorced\\u0022 width=\\u0022835\\u0022 height=\\u0022557\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a certain catharsis that comes from telling people about your divorce. It’s like a weight off your shoulders. Having to lie, watch your words, and dance around your true feelings is an extra burden you don’t need when you’re already going through a tough transition. You may not always get the reaction you want, and it can be difficult, but at least you’ll live authentically.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eHow to Start\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen you start telling people about your divorce, it can feel overwhelming. In the beginning, reach out to people directly. A simple phone call or even a visit to a trusted friend is a good way to start. Depending on how much you’ve opened up to them, they may already know something was wrong. Usually, they’ll be supportive and want to be there for you, which can feel like a ray of sunshine on a stormy day. Your talk may even deepen your relationship and lead to a more meaningful emotional connection.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSkip the Crowds\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nLarge social gatherings can be overwhelming, with well-meaning friends and loved ones asking questions and trying their best to support you, but inadvertently making things even more difficult. It’s ok to take your time and decline the invite to social shindigs that you aren’t feeling up to just yet. Once you’ve had some time to have one-on-one conversations and start processing the news yourself, you’ll build the resilience you need to get back out there.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003ePeople will generally respond with care and concern to the news of your divorce, but, sometimes, you'll get a response you weren't expecting.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePut Social on Ice\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIt’s probably a good idea to avoid posting anything about your divorce on social media, especially before you’ve communicated with those that will be most directly affected, like children. You’ll also want to refrain from posting negative comments about your soon-to-be ex. Sharing online opens you up to unwanted attention and comments, and, depending on what you post publicly, your spouse may be able to use it against you in court. Staying away from sharing details on social media for a while can offer you and your family privacy while you process this transition.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eKeep Reaching Out\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce can feel isolating and it’s important to keep reaching out. As you tell more people about what you’re going through, continue connecting with them. Friends can be a great source of advice, comfort, and support. It doesn’t always have to be a phone call or an in-person meeting. If you’re more comfortable texting, sending an email, or even writing a letter, that’s what you should do. Be intentional about the communication methods you use, as your story will often spark a conversation that can be meaningful.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eNegative Responses\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPeople will generally respond with care and concern to the news of your divorce, but, sometimes, you’ll get a response you weren’t expecting. If you have friends who were close to both you and your spouse, they may get angry or even blame you for the break, especially if they’ve been talking to the other party. They may also try to stay neutral, which can feel like a betrayal because they didn’t choose you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people get overly emotional about the situation you’re going through or don’t show the support you need, it’s ok to distance yourself from them, at least temporarily. If you continue interacting with them, it could cause you emotional pain and may even make you lash out in anger, costing a friendship. With space, you’ll be able to process your feelings, and, in time, you’ll be able to handle theirs better.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eUnsolicited Advice\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSome people who hear that you’re going through a divorce will have advice they want to give you. That’s a good thing. It shows that they care about you and want to help you with some knowledge or experience they’ve gained. However, it can also come from a place of self-importance and can be both unsolicited and unwanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry not to be offended when this happens. Even a “know-it-all” probably still cares and only voices their concern in the language they know best. And you don’t have to follow anyone’s advice. You don’t even have to listen to it if you don’t want to. You can politely ask for some time before you continue discussing the divorce and move on. Ultimately, it’s your life, and all decisions are yours.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGetting Together\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nEventually, you’ll want to start going out and being social again. That can be easier if you start with a small group of close friends who are already aware of the situation and have had a chance to talk to you individually. If possible, choose a setting where you’re comfortable. If you don’t want to talk about the divorce, tell your friends beforehand, and try to stay calm if they mention it anyway. Overall, it’s important to have fun. Your marriage may be over, but your life isn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarger parties and family get-togethers can be more challenging. Not everyone will know what’s happening; some will only know a little. You may get more unsolicited advice or inappropriate questions than you’re used to. Having a plan and a good friend or small group attend with you can deflect some of the attention.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCloser to Closure\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nNo one likes to feel vulnerable, but sometimes that’s just what you need. Having someone you can open up to can be powerful and healthy for your emotional well-being. It can be a trusted friend, family member, or a professional such as a psychiatrist. The important thing is that you reach out. People won’t know what you need until you let them in. If you ask for support, you just might get it.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

It is determined based on each spouse's situation, the assets and property being divided, the children involved, how wealth is distributed in the relationship and any disparities that exist, and the state and local laws where you reside. Consult a DivorceLawyer.Com law firm member who can provide guidance based on your unique circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14577 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Understanding_Spousal_Support.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Understanding Spousal Support\\u0022 width=\\u0022772\\u0022 height=\\u0022515\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on your state, alimony is not necessarily required, but a court can award it to either party if it is justified by financial circumstances. It is separate from child support, which is intended to provide for children following a marriage. A judge will mostly order alimony payments in cases that involve lengthy marriages, when one spouse doesn’t work, or a condition prevents a spouse from supporting themselves. Alimony is not considered a broad remedy, but a support system if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several types of alimony and spousal support that you might encounter, which generally fall into two categories: temporary and permanent.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eShort Term Alimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAlso called Temporary Alimony or pendente lite, these payments are ordered by the court during the divorce proceedings before they are finalized. They are often granted when a trial takes a long time, one spouse is experiencing financial hardship, or when mortgages or other bills can’t be afforded until a settlement is reached. The amount will be determined based on an estimate of the final alimony payments.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eRehabilitative Alimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nRehabilitative alimony is an arrangement in which one spouse receives payments for a short period to become financially independent, acquire new career skills, engage in school or training, and find or further their careers. It’s a way to ensure all parties have a fair chance to maintain and rebuild their lives after a divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\nPayments are granted based on need, but are not intended to be permanent. Also called “bridge the gap” alimony, this arrangement can last as little as a few months or for years, depending on the situation. There are multiple payment arrangements that can be made, including periodic (like monthly), lump sum, or diminishing payments where the amount is larger at first and then decreasing over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common reason for awarding this type of alimony is when one spouse puts their career on hold to care for a family or otherwise support the marriage.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePermanent Alimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPermanent, or Long-Term Alimony is less common and is usually reserved for particularly lengthy marriages in which one spouse didn’t work or if one spouse has a disability or life circumstance that would make them unable to seek employment. These arrangements may last for the recipient's life, although there are often stipulations that the payments will end if they get remarried or enter a long-term committed relationship.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eYou deserve support to become independent and pursue a new, successful life.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFactors Determining Alimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf your state is an equitable distribution state, courts may order alimony payments to ensure that both parties are financially stable and that assets are divided fairly. The amount of alimony is not based on a strict formula and there are multiple factors that go into the decision.\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThese include:\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe standard of living enjoyed during the marriage.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe age and emotional condition of each spouse.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe duration of the marriage. Alimony probably won’t be granted if it’s less than three years.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eFinancial resources of each person. Alimony generally won’t be granted if they are equal.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTime required to become financially independent through education and training.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIndividual earning capacity.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIndividual assets.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAny other factors that the court determines are relevant.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eNonpayment of Alimony or Support\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you are awarded alimony and your former spouse fails to make payments, you have several options. Consider hiring a lawyer who can work with the judge to get your former spouse to comply and pay any back support due. If you can’t afford a lawyer or prefer to go it alone, you can file a complaint with law enforcement or contact the Department of Human Services in your area for support.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMoney can be a severe point of contention when pursuing a divorce. With the relationship ending, there may be a reluctance to fulfill financial obligations. It’s essential to know your rights and those of your children.

During your divorce, the division of these assets will be determined based on local and state laws and your specific circumstances. You might work with your spouse directly or through mediators to come to an agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the court can decide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14579 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Homes_Properties_and_Assets_in_Divorce.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Homes, Properties, and Assets in Divorce\\u0022 width=\\u0022795\\u0022 height=\\u0022530\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dividing assets in divorce, a holistic approach is often used to try to create fairness for all parties. In the end, assets might be divided based on value, history, lifestyle, infidelity, or the earning potential of either individual, and will be guided by local and state laws.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eMarital and Private Property\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFirst, it is important to understand the two types of assets that you might have in your portfolio: marital and private. Marital property includes things that you acquire during your marriage and is jointly owned by both spouses. There are exceptions, like inheritances and personal gifts, which might be considered private property regardless of when they were acquired. During a divorce, marital property is usually a part of the division of assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings that you brought into the marriage with you are typically considered private property and may remain so through your divorce. If there’s a dispute, you may be asked for proof of private ownership for anything you claim was owned prior to marriage.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eUnderstanding your rights will ensure that your assets are divided fairly between spouses.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eEquitable Distribution States\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn an equitable distribution state, marital assets will be divided fairly between the spouses. Based on financial circumstances, this might not mean a 50/50 split. Instead, property is divided so that both parties can maintain their quality of life. When deciding how to distribute property, various factors will be considered, including things like:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAlimony.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eChild support payments.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eDebt, assets, and the financial situation of each spouse.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eCurrent and future earning potential of each person.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eConduct before and during the divorce.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eWrongful actions that might have resulted in wasted assets.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe long-term well-being of each spouse.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCommunity Property State\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn a community property state, assets are usually split 50/50. This means that each spouse has the right to half of the value of marital property that the couple acquired together. There are some exceptions, like assets covered by a prenuptial agreement, gifts, and property received through inheritance, so it’s best to check with an attorney to fully understand your rights under the state laws where you live.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSelling a House During a Divorce\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSelling your home because of a divorce can be difficult. You may have deep, sentimental feelings, especially if you raised children or spent many years there. However, it is often the most straightforward way to divide the property's value.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is an example of how the process can work:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAn agreement is reached, either by the couple or through the court, outlining how property will be divided based on its value.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eOnce terms are settled, the couple can file for divorce and include the details of the house sale.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eBoth parties agree on a real estate agent.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eUpon sale of the house, debts, mortgage payments, or liens are settled out of the estate.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eProceeds are divided based on the plan for the division of assets.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\nIf one spouse doesn’t want to move, they can often buy out the other person’s equity in the property if they are in a financial position to do so. This can be accomplished with a lump sum payment, through a loan, or a payment plan.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSelling a Vehicle or Other Large Property\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe sale and division of significant property like automobiles may follow the same rules as those for the distribution of the value of a house. The spouses will come to an agreement or have one handed down by the court, and then an agent can be chosen to handle the sale and oversee the fair and equitable allocation of the funds. One person may also offer to purchase the property outright from the other.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePrioritizing the Family Home for Children\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn a divorce case with children, there are additional considerations. The primary focus is usually protecting any children involved and minimizing the impact on their lives. Depending on short and long-term custody agreements, the parent with primary custody may be viewed as being more deserving or in need of the house or other significant property, such as a car. Creating a sense of normalcy and continuity for the kids is paramount throughout this process.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eRetirement Accounts\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nRetirement accounts and future pensions are considered in the division of assets. The judge may institute a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) when assets such as 401(k) funds cannot be withdrawn. The QDRO will designate the division of assets into two accounts. In some cases, these funds can be offered to one of the spouses instead of alimony, support payments, or certain property. The process can be tricky, and you should consult with a legal professional to prevent loss of benefits.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eTaxes\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA considerable tax burden can reduce the proceeds when homes or properties are sold during a divorce. The timing of your house sale may impact your tax liability, and you may be eligible for exclusions. Consult an attorney or CPA to discuss your situation so that you can make informed choices about the best way forward.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is a time of transition. Understanding your rights will ensure that your assets are divided fairly between spouses. While selling your home and beloved property can be challenging, it can also be cathartic and help you move on. As you start your new life, you won’t be burdened with memories from the past and can instead focus on making new ones. It can be a scary time, but also one of opportunity and potential.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

While not all instances of infidelity end in divorce, it is a common reason for couples to separate. The impact of cheating on a divorce is multifaceted, affecting everything from emotional well-being to legal outcomes. Though rarely prosecuted, it is also still a crime in sixteen states. If you or your spouse has cheated, you might be wondering how infidelity will affect your divorce in terms of the legal process, emotional dynamics, and financial consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14584 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Will_a_cheating_spouse_impact_my_divorce.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Will a Cheating Spouse Impact My Divorce?\\u0022 width=\\u0022765\\u0022 height=\\u0022510\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eEmotional Toll\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe emotional toll of infidelity can significantly influence divorce proceedings. Discovering a partner’s affair can lead to feelings of anger, betrayal, shame, and sadness. These emotions can cloud judgment during divorce negotiations, making it difficult to remain objective. Once trust is broken, it can be incredibly difficult to restore. This loss of trust can permeate every aspect of the divorce process, from the division of assets to child custody arrangements.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCounseling and Therapy\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSome couples attempt to work through infidelity in therapy. If, despite counseling, divorce is the outcome, therapy may shift to helping individuals navigate the emotional aftermath. Therapists and counselors often play a significant role in helping the betrayed spouse manage the emotional trauma of infidelity during divorce.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eInfidelity is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a marriage.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePotential Implications\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn many states, divorce is no longer solely based on fault grounds like adultery. Many places have adopted no-fault divorce laws, which allow couples to end their marriage without assigning blame. However, infidelity may still influence legal outcomes, depending on where the divorce is filed and the specific circumstances of the case.\\r\\nDepending on the laws where you live, infidelity may or may not have a direct impact on your case. In some states, the court may not consider the affair when making decisions. In others, infidelity can be grounds for divorce, and a cheating spouse might face consequences, such as paying higher spousal support or receiving a smaller portion of the marital assets through the division of property. It is best to consult an attorney to understand how your local laws and circumstances might be affected.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eLitigation Costs\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nEven if infidelity is not used to establish grounds for divorce, cases involving infidelity often become more contentious, leading to higher legal fees and prolonged court battles. The emotional baggage associated with the affair can cause both parties to engage in costly litigation, with disputes over everything from property division to alimony.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eAlimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAlimony, also called spousal support, can be influenced by infidelity, especially in states that recognize fault-based divorce. In these cases, the non-cheating spouse may argue that the affair contributed to the breakdown of the marriage, and this could result in a more favorable alimony arrangement. However, in no-fault divorce states, infidelity usually does not affect alimony unless the affair directly caused significant financial harm to the marital estate.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eMarital Property\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA common financial repercussion of infidelity happens when a cheating spouse uses marital assets, like money earned during the marriage, to support their affair. This could include spending money on hotel rooms, gifts, vacations, or supporting the third party financially. In some cases, courts may order the unfaithful spouse to reimburse the marital estate for any funds spent on the affair, which can be considered “marital waste” or “dissipation of assets.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIf significant financial damage was caused by the cheating spouse’s affair, this may also be factored into the division of property. If, for example, marital assets were depleted as a result of the affair, the court may award a larger share of the remaining assets to the other spouse. In cases of abandonment, where one spouse moves in with the person they were cheating with before the divorce is final, it may influence how the judge divides the estate. Since the remaining person is paying all the bills even before the divorce is final, they may have more of a claim to large property such as real estate or vehicles.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eChild Custody\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhether or not infidelity will impact child custody decisions depends on your state laws and unique circumstances. In many cases, courts prioritize the best interests of the child. Unless a child’s safety is in question, the goal is to find an arrangement that maintains stability and the opportunity for children to have a relationship with both parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the cheating spouse’s behavior has a negative impact on the child or exposes the child to an inappropriate or dangerous environment, it could influence custody rulings. A court might limit custody rights or impose specific conditions based on the infidelity's effect on parenting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, if it can be proven that the person your spouse is cheating with is dangerous to the well-being of the children, that can potentially affect custody and child support payments. The court may perform a background check on them, look into old custody hearings, or investigate whether they have a history of violence or drug and alcohol abuse.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePrenuptial Agreements\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married that includes infidelity clauses, there could be financial penalties outlined in the agreement. Some prenuptial agreements stipulate that in the event of infidelity, the wronged spouse receives a larger share of the assets or receives some other form of compensation. These agreements can provide leverage during divorce negotiations.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eThe Path Ahead\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nInfidelity is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a marriage. It’s painful, embarrassing, and can cause conflict, even outside of the marriage. Knowing your rights is essential. It’s a complex process, but the help of a qualified lawyer can make it easier and provide necessary guidance.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

When there are children involved, this already arduous process becomes even more complicated. Parents have a legal obligation to support their children financially, regardless of whether or not they have custody. If you have children in the mix, it is important to understand child support and the factors that determine it.\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-89373 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Understanding_Child_Support.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Understanding Child Support\\u0022 width=\\u0022810\\u0022 height=\\u0022540\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eDetermining Child Support\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDetermining how much child support will be awarded requires the court to consider a myriad of factors. The courts aim to maintain a financial environment for your children that closely mirrors their accustomed standard of living before divorce. To achieve this, they generally look at the income of one or both parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircumstances vary from family to family. Health challenges, loss of income, special needs and how much time the non-custodial parent spends (and has spent previously) with children will all be considered when determining a child support arrangement. It’s also important to note that payment modifications can be made in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nChild support laws vary from state to state. Most states use \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ncsl.org/human-services/child-support-guideline-models\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eone of three models\\u003c/a\\u003e to determine responsibility:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIncome Shares Model\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003ePercentage of Income Model\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMelson Model\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eYour new arrangement is about putting your child’s needs above all else, including how you feel about your ex-spouse.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eIncome Shares Model\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMost states, including New York, Maine, Georgia, and Pennsylvania use the Income Shares Model to determine child support. This model takes the income of both parents into account and is based on the underlying principle that the financial state of children after the divorce should be as close as possible to the financial state they had before the divorce. It calculates child support by evaluating what proportion of income would have been spent on the children when the parents lived together, including a standard childcare obligation outlined by the state as well as extra expenses like child care, education, and special medical needs. The total amount spent on caring for children in the family is prorated to each parent based on their percentage of the combined income.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePercent Income Model\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSome states use the Percent Income Model, which only considers the noncustodial parent’s income when determining child support. This model typically uses a standard rate per child based on the non-custodial parent’s income and makes adjustments up or down for special circumstances to calculate the child support amount due.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eMelson Model\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA handful of states use the Melson Model. This approach calculates child support by considering the income of both parents, similar to the Income Shares Model, but adds a component to ensure that each spouse’s basic needs are met in addition to those of the children to arrive at the final amount.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eTracking Expenditures\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nParents facing divorce commonly want to know if the person receiving child support needs to track how they spend the money. In most states, they do not. Child support calculations take into account all of the things that children may indirectly or directly benefit from. In reality, child support often contributes to paying for a portion of the mortgage, utilities, or auto expenses that benefit everyone in the household, in addition to covering expenses that only benefit the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only time that tracking expenses may be needed is when a request is made to increase child support. In this case, the court will likely want documentation showing that the amount granted is not adequate to provide for the children.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eTypes of Payments\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen discussing child support, most people think about payments made to one parent by the other. Child support can include other types of payments that directly provide for the needs of the child. For example, a parent may directly cover medical insurance, school tuition, out-of-pocket costs, or extracurricular activities as part of their child support obligation.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eDuration\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nChild support typically continues until a child graduates from high school, not to exceed 20 years of age. A few states require child support payments to be made until the child completes college.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eModifications After Divorce\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nLike custodial issues, the amount of child support can be modified after a divorce is final. Most states require that you show a change of financial circumstance or that the needs of the child have changed to modify existing child support obligations. Typically, a parent will file a request for a change when the income of the person who is paying child support significantly increases or decreases.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eNon-Payment of Child Support\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you find yourself in a situation where your child’s other parent fails to pay child support, consult an attorney. You may need to take your ex-spouse back to court, file a complaint with law enforcement, or contact the Department of Human Services for additional support. Failure to pay child support can result in fines and jail time, in addition to making the payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to note that the law considers child support separate from custody and visitation schedules. If your ex fails to pay child support, you cannot withhold visitation. Doing so may put your own custodial and visitation rights at risk. Though it can be frustrating, you should always go through the proper legal channels to have child support payments enforced if you run into challenges.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSage Separations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe emotions that coincide with ending a marriage can make it difficult to compromise. When it comes to child support, it’s important to remember that your new arrangement is about putting your child’s needs above all else, including how you feel about your ex-spouse. Whether you are the custodial parent or the parent paying child support, each comes with its own challenges. Keeping the proceedings as fair and diplomatic as possible will help make things better for everyone involved.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

When you are contemplating divorce, it is important to educate yourself about the process before you make your final decision to go forward. As part of your research, you can schedule an initial consultation with an attorney so that they can explain the process, assess your unique circumstances, and answer any questions that you might have. It is also an opportunity to ensure that the attorney you’ve selected for your consultation is the best fit for you and your situation. The initial consultation should be about an hour, and you should expect to pay the hourly rate for the attorney you meet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-89376 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/What_to_Expect_at_Your_Initial_Divorce_Consultation.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022What to Expect at Your Initial Divorce Consultation\\u0022 width=\\u0022853\\u0022 height=\\u0022569\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eBe Prepared\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFor the initial consultation, you will want to be well-prepared so that you can get the most out of your hour.

You don't need to prove what has happened for the court to grant your divorce. Conduct is important for some issues, though, like alimony, division of property, and child custody, so your attorney will want to know. Ahead of your first meeting, you may want to reflect on problems or events that have led you to this point and be ready to share them openly. It may help to talk them over with a trusted friend ahead of time to gain perspective or write them down.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that your attorney can best serve you, it is important to be honest, even if you are embarrassed by past events. Experienced divorce attorneys are used to hearing all kinds of allegations, and will be there to help you achieve the best possible outcome. They can only help if they have all of the facts. So that they are not caught by surprise later on, be sure to share anything that your spouse might allege about you in addition to things that you share about your spouse’s behavior.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinances\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nYou should be prepared to talk about your financial situation. Your attorney will want to know the financial history of both you and your spouse. Be prepared to answer questions about whether you both work or have in the past, the nature of your occupations, and whether either of you is a stay-at-home parent now or in the past. Your attorney will also ask about assets and liabilities, like savings accounts, property and vehicles that you own, stocks, and retirement accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good idea to bring your last three years’ income tax returns. This will help provide a clearer picture of your finances, and may help your attorney spot things that might have been missed. A common problem in assessing finances is that a nonworking spouse often has no idea what their partner earns. If your joint tax returns aren’t easily accessible, you have the right to call your accountant to ask for a copy of your returns. They can often easily be emailed to you, or you can pick up a copy so that you can bring them to your first meeting.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eProperty\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAs part of your financial picture, you should be prepared to discuss details about any property that you own. It is helpful to know the fair market value and any remaining mortgages or loans for each. If possible, it is also important to know the monthly expenses related to each property, including regular maintenance, utilities, and services like lawn or pest control, and if you generate any rental income from any of your properties.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eChildren\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you have children, you should be prepared to discuss the level of involvement that each party has in raising them. Your attorney may ask things like who plans play dates, schedules doctor’s appointments, participates in teacher conferences, attends extracurricular activities, and engages in unstructured free time. This information will help your attorney advise you about parenting issues after divorce, like custody and parenting time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one spouse is a stay-at-home parent, your attorney will also want to understand plans for re-entering the workforce. They may ask about past work experience, marketable skills, and whether the person will need a period of time to go back to school or build skills before being able to find work. They will also want to understand how re-entering school or the workforce will affect childcare, and how this will be addressed.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePrenuptial Agreement\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you signed a prenuptial agreement before you were married, it is a good idea to bring a copy to your meeting. Your attorney will want to know any agreements that were made about things like the division of property and alimony ahead of the marriage. They will also review the contract to evaluate whether they think the court will find it valid at the time of divorce, based on how the prenuptial was structured.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eInformed Decision\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMoving forward with divorce is a big decision. An initial consultation can give you a general idea of what to expect. If you have provided a full picture of your circumstances, your attorney can share their thoughts on how property might be divided and how much child support and alimony may possibly be awarded by the court. With this knowledge, you can make a more informed decision about how you want to proceed as you move towards the future you want to build for you and your family.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

One of the most important decisions you will make early on is which type of process you will use to make decisions throughout the divorce – mediation, collaboration, or litigation. The process you select may impact your future relationship with your ex-spouse, your future co-parenting relationship, and your level of satisfaction with the final divorce judgment. There are pros and cons to each, and understanding the differences can help you find the best fit for your situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-89378 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ChoosingtheRightDivorceProcessMediationCollaborationorLitigation.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Choosing the Right Divorce Process\\u0022 width=\\u0022803\\u0022 height=\\u0022535\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022mediation\\u0022\\u003eMediation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMediation is a facilitated discussion between spouses with the help of a mediator. The mediator is sometimes, but not always, an attorney themselves, but they do not represent either party. You can still work with a personal attorney, but they may not always be present in the mediation sessions. If you use the mediation process, consult your attorney for the best approach for your unique circumstances and preferences.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eHow it works\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nOver a series of sessions, the mediator works with both spouses to discuss issues, work through anything that needs to be resolved, gather information needed to answer any questions that might come up, and pull together an agreement. The attorneys or mediator then draws up a settlement agreement, which is executed by the parties. The process of mediation offers autonomy because there are few formal rules and you are able to work together with your spouse on the key issues of your divorce. This can be empowering for some couples as they work through their divorce together, and can be overwhelming for others.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWho is it for\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nMediation is a good fit for people who have a fairly balanced relationship, where both people feel able to speak for themselves. It is important that each spouse feels able to state their views, and would not be in a position of holding back because they are afraid of their partner’s potential reactions.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWhy it works\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nMediation works when a couple is comfortable dealing directly with each other and the issues that need to be resolved are relatively less contentious. When couples can speak frankly and work out issues pertaining to the divorce themselves, they are able to feel a real sense of ownership over their process and the result.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eBe honest with yourself about what you need.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022collaboration\\u0022\\u003eCollaboration\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCollaboration, or collaborative divorce, is a type of mediation where couples work with each other and a team of experts in fields like legal, emotional, financial, and parenting, to resolve the issues that pertain to their divorce. The lawyers involved are typically not allowed to litigate the case, so everyone in the room is focused on reaching a settlement.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eHow it works\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nA collaborative lawyer works with both spouses and their attorneys in an informal setting to express their concerns and identify the issues that are most important to them. A team is assembled that helps work through each issue. The group evaluates the economic and social realities of the case and creates options that make sense for both parties. Once agreed, the team develops a resolution so that the divorce can be finalized.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWho is it for\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nCollaboration is a good fit for people who want more flexibility than a traditional courtroom and want to work out their issues amongst themselves with some support in doing so. They might need support having their voices heard, and might not feel entirely comfortable doing that on their own.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWhy it works\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nCollaborative divorce works when both parties are comfortable working directly with each other outside of court and with the help of a team to find resolutions. Having an attorney in the room can offer the reassurance of an ally with your best interests in mind. Also, having various experts to help address your specific issues can help couples find some sense of closure and more satisfaction in their divorce outcome.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022litigation\\u0022\\u003eLitigation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nLitigation is the most traditional way that people work towards divorce. Couples work with attorneys to understand their rights and work through the issues of the case, leveraging the expertise of trusted legal counsel.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eHow it works\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nBoth spouses hire lawyers and work through their legal team toward settlement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the case will be argued in court where a judge will make final decisions about issues like division of assets, child custody, child support, and alimony. Once the trial begins, couples may still settle until the judge makes a final decision.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWho is it for\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nLitigation may be the best option in complex cases, where two sides just can’t agree on their own, where there is domestic violence, fear, or bullying, or where there seems to be an impenetrable smokescreen between individuals. Because mediation and collaboration are voluntary, litigation is also the only option if either spouse refuses a different process.\\r\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWhy it works\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nLitigation offers a pathway to divorce through guidelines and rules applied by the court. Regardless of a couple’s ability to agree on a way forward, a judge can resolve any outstanding issues and finalize the divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022go-your-own-way\\u0022\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nChoosing the right process for your situation is paramount. Whether you decide to engage directly with your soon-to-be ex through mediation or collaboration, or you want to move to litigation to resolve your issues, be honest with yourself about what you need. This will help you move down the right path from the beginning and start assembling the team you need to create an outcome that you can move forward with.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Mediation\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#mediation\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Collaboration\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#collaboration\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Litigation\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#litigation\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Go your own way\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#go-your-own-way\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

What happens to the company when your marriage ends? When considering the future, your options include selling the business, a buyout, and continuing to co-own the business together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-89383 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sharing_a_Business_When_a_Marriage_Ends.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Sharing a Business When a Marriage Ends\\u0022 width=\\u0022804\\u0022 height=\\u0022536\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the option to continue running a business together after you separate is something you are considering, there are a variety of factors to think about. An attorney can help you evaluate potential implications and risks. There are also often intense feelings when couples split, as well as conflicts, grudges, and other issues that make up all of the reasons for divorce. These issues can cause serious problems when dealing with something as high stakes as a business, which you and your employees might rely on to pay bills and feed families.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you weigh your options, be honest with yourself and with your soon-to-be ex-spouse about how you feel and how you see the future. You’ll need to consider the emotional toll and your overall compatibility to operate as a team when you are no longer married. Despite going through a divorce, both you and your spouse will need to openly communicate with each other about the changes that a future co-ownership might bring, and may find that multiple conversations are needed to make sure that this is a good idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings you will want to consider include:\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eBoundaries\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOnce the divorce is finalized, you will be in a position of redefining your relationship from personal to professional. This can take time and should be approached with introspection, understanding, and empathy. At first, it can be challenging to separate past emotions from the present situation, but it often gets easier as routine sets in and you adapt to the new situation. A healthy approach might include giving each other enough space at work to be autonomous and in control, while still collaborating with each other and the team to get the job done. Regularly scheduled check-ins can help.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eIntense Emotions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIt might seem easy to create boundaries with an ex-spouse in a professional setting, but seeing them day after day may reveal unresolved feelings. Before choosing to share the business post-divorce, it is important to examine how you really feel. Otherwise, your emotions may surprise you later and come out in ways that could be harmful to the business.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eTrust\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf trust was an issue in your marriage, it can cause cracks in the business that you run together. Over time, these feelings can spill over into the operation of your business and may cause discord among employees or confusion among customers and clients.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSpace\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen running a business together, you may not find space that you want or need from your ex. You could be working together, seeing each other, talking, and collaborating, even if it is just about business. Without distance, you may find that you have less time to process and heal in the way that you had hoped or that unwanted feelings linger.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eDecisions are often easier to make before tempers flare.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCorporate Structure \\u0026amp; Roles\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhile you may have operated under some assumptions while married, it is important to clarify what your role and the role of your spouse will be within the organization going forward. By explicitly defining positions within the corporate structure, you can designate each person's responsibilities within the overall operation. You may want to keep the same roles that you previously held, but other arrangements can be made.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCreating a Contract\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAs you re-imagine how to run the business with your former spouse, you may want to develop a more structured contractual agreement than when married. A contract can outline how you intend the company to operate so that there is no confusion, and each person will know precisely what their rights and responsibilities are. Your attorney can advise you and help draft this document.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eProfits\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMoney can be particularly contentious. Financial and legal advisors can help you and your former spouse outline how the business's profits will be divided going forward. Establishing this can prevent conflict and stave off legal action down the road. It may also be helpful to get a valuation of the business’s worth so that everyone knows their stake.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eDispute Resolution Mechanism\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nConflicts may arise in the future, and because you and your spouse have a history and may have some unresolved emotions about one another, it may be helpful to choose a conflict resolution method that can be employed before you need it. Commonly, businesses choose some form of mediation or arbitration, but an attorney can advise you on options.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eExit Strategy\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nHaving an exit strategy makes good business sense in any case, but may be particularly important for partners trying to run a business after divorce. Having an exit strategy planned ahead of time can guide you in case it becomes apparent that you are not able to make the business relationship work. Decisions are often easier to make before tempers flare. A solid backup plan can help prevent further escalation and allow for the dissolution of your arrangement to happen as smoothly as possible.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eBusiness Coaching\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSpeaking to a professional consultant, particularly one with experience co-running a business post-divorce, can provide valuable insights into the situation and how others have handled it. They may offer practical advice on how to navigate the operational pitfalls and create a more harmonious work environment.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eLegal Counsel\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA lawyer should be consulted before you finalize the decision to continue running your business together. They can advise on the legal ramifications and potential liabilities of this arrangement, suggest contracts and structures that can prevent and resolve potential conflict, and continue to be valuable throughout the life of the partnership.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSharing a business after divorce is possible, but it requires open communication, patience, empathy, and a willingness to redefine your relationship to work in new ways. In some cases, it may be difficult, but, if done well, it may allow your company to remain strong and healthy with the talents of both people who envisioned and built it.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

All US states recognize prenuptial agreements, though states vary in how they govern them. Couples have different reasons for considering a prenup, which can be used to protect personal assets, demystify financial responsibilities, or offer peace of mind in preparation for marriage.\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-89385 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Prenuptial_Agreements_and_Divorce.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Prenuptial Agreements and Divorce\\u0022 width=\\u0022804\\u0022 height=\\u0022536\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eWhat Is Covered in a Prenuptial Agreement?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA prenuptial agreement requires both parties to openly discuss their finances before marriage, including assets, debts, and financial expectations. This level of transparency can prevent misunderstandings and ensure that both parties are on the same page about their financial future.\\r\\nPrenuptial agreements can address a wide range of financial matters, including:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe division of marital and separate property\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eProtection from debts\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTerms of spousal support (alimony)\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eManagement of family businesses or inheritances\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eClarification of financial responsibilities during the marriage\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nWhile prenups primarily deal with financial matters, they can also include provisions for how certain personal assets, like family heirlooms or sentimental belongings, will be handled. They do not typically cover issues like child support or child custody because issues solely relating to children are usually decided at the time of divorce.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eYou may find yourself wondering if your prenup will hold up through the divorce process.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eWho Should Consider a Prenup\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhether or not you decide to explore one is a highly personal decision that is often influenced by the number of assets you or your spouse are bringing into the marriage or the income that one or both of you are earning when you say ‘I do.’ It is not unusual for people who have been divorced before to want a prenuptial agreement because of their previous experience.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eValidity of a Prenup\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFor those facing the end of a marriage, you may find yourself wondering if your prenup will hold up in the divorce process. Although they are intended to be legally binding, prenuptial agreements need a very specific approach to hold up in court and should be reviewed by an attorney before signing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, prenups are enforceable throughout the United States, but governance varies by state, and they need to be reviewed to determine whether they are valid at the time of divorce. You should consult a divorce lawyer about the validity of your prenup, which often considers three factors:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#disclosure\\u0022\\u003eDisclosure\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#unconscionability\\u0022\\u003eUnconscionability\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#unforeseen-circumstances\\u0022\\u003eUnforeseen Circumstances\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch4 id=\\u0022disclosure\\u0022\\u003eDisclosure\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nOne key to a prenup’s validity at the time of divorce is how it was obtained. The most important issue is determining that there was fair and detailed financial disclosure by both spouses at the time that a prenup was signed. Otherwise, it might be determined that the agreement was obtained through fraud or by misrepresentation of important information. To help avoid this, a solid prenup may have exhibits and other disclosure statements.\\r\\n\\u003ch4 id=\\u0022unconscionability\\u0022\\u003eUnconscionability\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nA second factor in determining a prenup’s validity during divorce is whether the agreement was unconscionable, a legal term often defined as entering into a contract that no person would otherwise enter into. This is not the same as fair. Though independent legal counsel can help ensure that your interests are prioritized, typically, a prenup favors one party over the other by design. To hold up, however, they should have been signed free from things like unreasonable pressure, force, manipulation, or dishonesty.\\r\\n\\u003ch4 id=\\u0022unforeseen-circumstances\\u0022\\u003eUnforeseen Circumstances\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\r\\nA third factor in determining a prenup’s validity is whether your circumstances have changed to the extent that the agreement would be unfair at the time of divorce. Unforeseen changes throughout a marriage are common, so this is usually limited to a major event, such as a change in a person’s health that leaves them unable to support themself. Things like infidelity, children, or a change in financial circumstances are usually not considered unforeseen for determining the enforceability of a prenuptial agreement.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGo with Confidence\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPrenuptial agreements are not just about protecting assets — they are about ensuring financial transparency, reducing conflict, and creating a strong foundation for a successful marriage.

But what about the kids?\\r\\n\\r\\nMarriage is a partnership. When that ends, couples often find themselves navigating difficult decisions around how they will handle child custody arrangements once they are no longer married.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany worry about missing out on the day-to-day moments – the quiet after-school evenings, the chance to get to know friends in carpool, family dinners, and weekend extravaganzas. Being apart means that you’ll be redefining how and when you spend time with your children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd holidays. What about the holidays?\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eIt may take some time to find your groove, but the right custody arrangement can help everyone involved move forward\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\nDetermining the best arrangement to suit your needs and meet the needs of your children will serve your family well, but where should you start? While state laws and personal circumstances mean that each case will be unique, there are several options that many couples consider.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022standard\\u0022\\u003eStandard\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nStandard visitation is a traditional approach that recognizes a primary and secondary parent. Children are with the primary parent most of the time, often spending weekdays and every other weekend together. The secondary parent steps in every other weekend and one dinner or overnight on the opposite week. This arrangement works for many families and has historically been the most used model.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: Standard visitation offers fewer transfers for kids during the school week and is particularly convenient if one parent works a more time-intensive schedule or travels during the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: The role of parenting will fall more heavily on one parent than the other. If your parenting style already mirrors this, then it might be a good arrangement for your family. However, if you are a couple that has worked to achieve more of a 50/50 balance in parenting or career, this arrangement will feel very different for everyone involved.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022extended\\u0022\\u003eExtended\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nExtended visitation offers a little more time with the secondary parent. Rather than a Friday to Sunday weekend visit, every other weekend is an extended three-night visit, often starting on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: This approach generally offers a consistent home base for kids during the school week and works well when both parents have some flexibility in their schedules.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: While slightly softened, the role of parenting still falls more heavily on one parent than the other with this arrangement.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022weekly\\u0022\\u003eWeekly\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe weekly exchange is another common way to arrange joint custody. It is a week-on, week-off approach where children switch houses every other week that offers a genuine 50/50 split of time between parents. The perk of this arrangement is that parents have equal time with their kids, but, for an active and engaged parent, seven nights is a long time to be away.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: The role of parenting is evenly shared. This arrangement also creates predictable scheduling, which often works well for working parents and older children with busy lifestyles.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: Seven days is a long time to be away from each other. While scheduling may be easier, the constant change may make it harder to maintain routines, like bedtime and family social hours.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022223\\u0022\\u003e2/2/3\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe 2/2/3 is a relatively newer approach to joint custody that better aligns with a 50/50 parenting style. With this plan, children stay with each parent two nights per week, and alternate weekends for the remaining three days. The weekly schedule might resemble the following example:\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-13296 size-full\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Co-parenting_After_Divorce.png\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Co-parenting_After_Divorce\\u0022 width=\\u0022600\\u0022 height=\\u0022338\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: The role of parenting is more evenly shared. This arrangement offers less time between visits and allows for each parent to have both weekday and extended weekend time on a regular basis. There are also predictable days each week that children will be with each parent, which can help with scheduling activities. Families with younger children often explore this option because of the shortened time between exchanges.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: If one parent has a less predictable work schedule, this arrangement may be difficult to maintain. If parents do not live near each other or communicate about their children’s needs well, frequent exchanges during the week can be challenging. Over time, a commitment to live in the child’s school district may be difficult to maintain, and some compromises may be needed.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022your-own-way\\u0022\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThere are multiple variations of the standard, extended, weekly, and 2/2/3 custody arrangements. A skilled attorney can help you tailor a plan to fit the needs of your family and align with your state laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may take some time to find your groove, but the right custody arrangement can help everyone involved move forward. Over time, as your children grow and their needs change, don’t be afraid to revisit the plan, especially if you find that things that were once working have since broken down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough you may no longer be married, if you are committed to co-parenting you can create a solution that works.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn experienced attorney can help you navigate the options that best fit your family.

As you move through the legal exercise of ending a marriage, it is equally important to acknowledge that you are also moving through a healing journey in response to this defining life event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are distinct stages of divorce, each filled with its own emotions. You might experience them one at a time, or all at once. You may move through one stage more quickly than the other. They don’t necessarily happen in a linear fashion, and you can move back and forth between stages as your healing evolves. Just when you think you are standing on your feet, you might find yourself taking a seat again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-13299 size-full\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Six_Stages_of_Divorce.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Six stages of Divorce\\u0022 width=\\u0022600\\u0022 height=\\u0022400\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nAcknowledging the emotions and stages of divorce can be helpful.

This is the stage where you start to recognize that the person you married isn’t who you expected them to be and the life you have created isn’t the one you want anymore. As we evolve, our expectations change. We change. Our wants change. If you and your partner haven’t changed at the same pace or in the same direction, you may find yourself losing love for the life you’ve created together.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on, this is the stage where there is still a possibility of reconciliation. If you openly communicate, work together, and find a way back to each other, you may be able to find new common ground that works for you both.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, as you move through the divorce process, you may find that disillusionment grows because your partner’s behaviors and attitude towards divorce and life after may surprise you in ways that you didn’t expect. You may find that they genuinely aren’t the person that you thought they were or that being married to them isn’t what you thought it would be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eCommon emotions during this stage: disappointed, annoyed, irritated.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022dissatisfaction\\u0022\\u003eDissatisfaction\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDissatisfaction is marked by the open expression of unhappiness by one or both partners. This happens as the feelings of a mismatch grow stronger, which can lead to arguments and blame.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this phase, partners who are dedicated to salvaging the relationship will communicate openly and honestly, and may seek the support of counseling. They will also act with empathy and understanding so that they can work towards a common understanding of each other’s needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartners who are moving toward divorce may find themselves withdrawing, arguing more, and finding fault in each other when they can’t resolve their issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eCommon emotions during this stage: doubt, grief, stress, guilt, anger, relief, tension\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThere will be ups and downs, but recognizing that a \\u003cem\\u003enew future awaits\\u003c/em\\u003e is key.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022decision\\u0022\\u003eDecision\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe decision phase is a turning point. Deciding to divorce is difficult, and deciding to stay may not be easy. Some couples may take some time apart to test out how life could unfold without each other. Others worry about what will happen with their children, assets, or friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor couples moving forward with divorce, the decision is about making a firm choice and recognizing that there’s likely no going back. This begins a shift in identity for both individuals and families, and can bring on a deep sense of loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, for couples who decide to stay, it is important to determine whether you are both committed to the marriage and are willing to put in the work. If divorce looms over that, it’s unlikely that you will be successful. Both parties have to commit to taking divorce off the table, otherwise you may just be delaying the inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eCommon emotions during this stage: anger, tired, fed up, worry, guilt, uncertainty, sadness, resentment.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022action\\u0022\\u003eAction\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOnce a decision to divorce is made, the practicalities set in. You’ll want to find a good lawyer who can represent your interests. You’ll also start making preparations or movements toward separating assets and physical space, determining child custody, emotional separation, telling friends and family, and taking on all that your new identity encompasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eCommon emotions during this stage: anger, blame, practical, worry, sadness, shame, fear, guilt, resolve, strength.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022acceptance\\u0022\\u003eAcceptance\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAcceptance is all about finding your new self as you move through the world as a divorcee and newly single person. It is a process in and of itself that may come quickly for some, and take years for others. Be gentle with yourself during this time as you realize that your married life was not fulfilling, and that there is still life ahead. If you have children, they will need your help understanding that they are loved and that the divorce was not their fault. They might feel a loss of security, and their behaviors may communicate feelings that they cannot fully express with words.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might also be surprised by your own behaviors, thoughts, and actions as you explore the world through a new lens. This is common and comes as a product of the changes you are experiencing. There will be ups and downs, but recognizing that a new future awaits is key.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eCommon emotions during this phase: nervous, sad, hopeful, lonely, strong, refreshed, excited, ok.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022freedom\\u0022\\u003eFreedom\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce leads to starting over. In this shift from being married to single, you will likely experience a sense of freedom along the way. How you experience this will depend on many factors, including how long you held on to dissatisfaction and disillusionment before moving forward with decision and action, and your financial picture. For some, the moment you finally utter, “I want a divorce,” brings freedom and relief. For others, you might be wondering what this newly found freedom means – will I need to go back to work? How will I manage parenting on my own? Will I keep the same friends? Where will I celebrate the holidays? Freedom can be thrilling and terrifying all at once. One thing is certain – your life is yours alone to shape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eCommon emotions during this stage: hope, excitement, fear, invincible, determined, open.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022go-your-own-way\\u0022\\u003eGo Your Own Way\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce can be daunting, but you aren’t alone. As you move through the emotional stages of divorce, surround yourself with a good support system, including friends, family, and a good attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is your life. When it doesn’t turn out the way you thought it would, find a new way and create the life you want.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Disillusionment\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#disillusionment\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Dissatisfaction\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#dissatisfaction\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Decision\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#decision\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Action\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#action\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Acceptance\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#acceptance\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_5_title\":\"Freedom\",\"_contents_list_5_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_5_link_id\":\"#freedom\",\"_contents_list_5_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_6_title\":\"Go your own way\",\"_contents_list_6_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_6_link_id\":\"#go-your-own-way\",\"_contents_list_6_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":7,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

The other side of the bed is neatly made. He slept on the couch again. We fought last night and he stormed out. I didn’t even think about going into the living room to try and talk it out.

Our 10- and 7-year-olds sit at the table as their father walks in. “Daddy, you look sleepy,” says the littlest one. He glares at me. “Oh, Daddy just didn’t sleep great last night, that’s all.” Like it’s my fault. Like I told him to go sleep on the couch. Maybe I did. I don’t know. I can’t even remember what comes out of my mouth when we are arguing. I’m just so mad at him all of the time. He walks over to the kitchen table and kisses each of our kids on the top of the head. Years ago, they would shout, “kiss mommy, too!” and squeal when he did. But they know better now. Goodness knows the last time we kissed. Or hugged. Or even said something to each other that wasn’t dripping with disdain. The girls shoot glances at each other. They quietly eat their cereal.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eOnce it stopped being about our relationship with each other and started being about our relationship with the kids, we were finally able to turn a corner\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\nWhen we are around them, we try to pretend that everything is fine. We fight behind closed doors, but I can hear them scurrying away when one of us inevitably throws the door open to leave. I don’t know how this is affecting them, but I worry about the ramifications of divorce. I often wonder if it’s better for them to grow up in a house that’s ‘together’ but unhappy, or happy and apart. I worry about what kind of parents we will become.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eIt Happened\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nI didn’t have to wonder for very long. When he asked for a divorce, I felt relieved. Relieved that I didn’t have to take the first step. Relieved that finally, something might change. We started off with a mediator because we had literally forgotten how to talk to each other. But, as time went on, it got easier to communicate. The biggest step was that we had to trust that we were both putting our children first. Once it stopped being about our relationship with each other and started being about our relationship with the kids, we were finally able to turn a corner.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e18 Months Later\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIt’s his weekend with the girls. I’m on my way to pick them up. I ring the doorbell of his condo. I hear their footsteps as they throw open the door. “Mommy!” They yell in unison. Their father walks up behind them. He smiles and gives me a small wave. “Did you girls tell your mom the exciting news?” Our littlest grins wide, a large space where her top tooth once was. “Your tooth! Did the tooth fairy come?” She and her father both nod. “Five dollars.” he says, “the tooth fairy is going to go broke soon.” I smile and gather the girls. “Will we see you at Hannah’s soccer game Tuesday?” I ask. “I’ll be there.” he says. I wave over my shoulder as the girls and I head to the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is not mine anymore. But he is theirs.

Not that normal for us was anything good or healthy. We fought constantly. It had gotten to the point where I would throw and break things during our fights. I shouldn’t have been surprised by him asking. But I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in my head snapped when he handed me that large manila envelope. Maybe I thought he was bluffing? “WE LOVE EACH OTHER! Why are you doing this??” I cried. He kept his composure. This just made me more angry. “You never cared about me. Obviously this marriage meant nothing to you. Well buckle up. I’m going to make your life miserable.” Nothing. No reaction. And I exploded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hindsight, him not moving out right away gave me a false sense of hope. Unfortunately, I didn’t use this time to try and work things out. In fact, I went in the complete opposite direction.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eWe moved through our house like two strangers. He, avoiding me with silence. Me, sabotaging his day however I could\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\nI started off doing small, annoying things. He’d make a pot of coffee and I would walk in the kitchen and pour it down the drain. I’d leave the TV in the living room on loudly and hide the remote. I was like a petulant child. I’d like to say it stopped there. But it did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t get the reaction I was looking for, so I decided to go deeper. I would call his office phone 20 times a day. I started ordering things online – I didn’t even look to see what they were. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars of things, delivered to the house. The boxes would pile up at the front door. I didn’t move them, I wanted him to see them. I don’t know what I thought it would accomplish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved through our house like two strangers. He, avoiding me with silence. Me, sabotaging his day however I could. I threw his car keys in the trash. I loudly criticized him to our children, who still lived at home. I broke his favorite mug – the one our son made him in preschool. I poured water on his laptop when he wasn’t looking, enough to break it. I have to hand it to him, he never reacted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t know it then, but he had retained a lawyer who he had been keeping abreast of my behavior. I’m certain that his lack of response to me was at their recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe papers came on a Tuesday morning. I had been served. At that point, I hadn’t done anything productive to prepare for this divorce. I was so angry that all I cared about was making him unhappy. A friend who was a lawyer offered to help. At our first meeting she asked me about what I wanted. I stated, “I don’t want the divorce.” She looked at me. “Are you saying that you’ll be contesting this divorce?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on to explain what a contested divorce would mean. Long, drawn-out and expensive. At the end of the day, the divorce would still happen. I sighed. “Well he probably won’t want to make up with me after the way I’ve been acting.” A smile played on my lips, thinking about how miserable I had made him. That’s when reality set in. She said in no uncertain terms, “I don’t know what you’re doing in that house, but you need to stop now. Anything you’re doing he can bring up in court. Stop. Now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hindsight, I wish I had gone to see her weeks earlier. When we went to court, there it all was. The text messages, the harrassing, the records of my calling him over and over at work. The receipts from online shopping. I sat there, unbelievably embarrassed. Not just at my own behavior, but at the fact that my ex-husband had NOT reacted. I sat there, like an admonished child, listening to the judge tell me I was no longer allowed to text him. That our finances needed to be separated. Listening to her ask my ex-husband if he felt safe, and if he didn’t, he should feel empowered to call the police. From that point forward, we could communicate about our children and that was it. If I had just acted like a grownup from the start, maybe things would have gone differently.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t undo my behavior. And unfortunately, I can’t even try to make up for it. But maybe one day I’ll be able to explain to him what happened to me. Maybe one day, I’ll be able to understand it myself.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Coffee Talk Stories\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"Real Voices\",\"url\":\"https://www.divorcelawyer.com/learning-center/real-voices/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":1,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

According to Forbes, the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/divorce/how-much-does-divorce-cost/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003emedian cost\\u003c/a\\u003e of a divorce in the U.S. is $7,000, while the average is $15,000 - $20,000. The actual cost will depend on your unique circumstances, including the assets that must be divided, any children who must be accommodated, and how contentious the situation is between you and your spouse. Simple, uncontested cases can be as little as a few hundred dollars, while complex, drawn-out cases can run much higher, with some couples spending more than $100,000 to dissolve their marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-14581 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/How_much_will_my_divorce_cost.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022How Much Will My Divorce Cost?\\u0022 width=\\u0022760\\u0022 height=\\u0022508\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nThinking holistically, you may also encounter costs beyond fees for the process.

Filing legal paperwork can be difficult and sometimes fraught with anxiety. However, with an uncontested divorce where both parties agree, it is generally not that complicated or expensive. Filing fees vary by state, but are typically around $250 - $500.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all parties agree to terms ahead of time, it may not cost much more than the filing fees. In many cases, though, there is at least some need for arbitration or mediation to resolve any conflicts. Even if divorce is uncontested, you may want to seek legal advice to ensure that your interests are protected. In those situations, lawyers must be hired, which increases costs.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022legal-advice\\u0022\\u003eLegal Advice\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA lawyer will cost around $300 - $400 per hour or possibly more for top attorneys, depending on location, the complexity of your situation, and the size or nature of marital assets. Some firms may offer a fixed rate for certain services. If the proceedings take a long time or multiple appearances have to be made in court, costs are likely to increase.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022mediation\\u0022\\u003eMediation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMediation can sometimes reduce legal fees by providing an open forum for both parties to air their grievances and come to a reasonable conclusion. The cost of a mediator is about $100 - $400+ an hour, depending on the type and experience of the mediator. Attorneys are often part of the process, and their hourly rate will usually apply. You may want to have legal counsel on retainer so that you can ask questions and ensure you are protected throughout the process. Mediation doesn’t work for everyone, and having an attorney on hand in case it fails could also be helpful.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022additional-child\\u0022\\u003eAdditional Child-related expenses\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOutside of child support, you will have to create a safe and secure home for any children involved. Having two households means twice the food, clothing, and shelter have to be provided. You want to ensure that the kids feel as little disruption as possible, so you’ll have to spend the money to create a fun and safe environment for them, as will the other parent.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022beyond-the-court\\u0022\\u003eBeyond the Court Room\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA divorce is a major life change, and you’ll have to set up many things to start a new life and get back to a place where you feel steady and ready to move on. The outside costs of this process can be significant, depending on your situation.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThink about what comes next in life and make a financial plan\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eWith planning and forethought, you can build a new life and find a better path\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022relocation\\u0022\\u003eRelocation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nYou’re going to need a place to stay. Unfortunately, this will often be a sudden need, which may bring unfavorable financial terms, at least for a while. The cost of getting set back up can be significant. Enlisting the help of friends or family and staying in a spare room while the proceedings unfold can give you the space to get back on your feet so you can start a new life.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022mental-health\\u0022\\u003eMental Health \\u0026amp; Well-being\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is a significant life event and can be traumatic. It is important to find support and remember that you are not alone. Always know that there are people who want to help you.\\r\\n\\r\\nResources to explore include therapists, divorce groups, and support services from your church, synagogue, or place of worship. There are many options that offer help navigating divorce that can provide balance for your mental health and well-being. Consult your health insurance to understand potential coverage and costs associated with care options for you and any children that may be involved.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022restart\\u0022\\u003eRestarting Your Life\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIt’s a new day. Take a breath. Watch the sunrise, and let yourself feel the anticipation. You can create your own world as you find your way forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt isn’t going to be easy, but you’ve got this. Think about what comes next in life and make a financial plan. Consider the down payment on a new house or deposit on an apartment. Think about travel expenses and maybe buying a vehicle. Remember to factor in the costs of kids, food, and utilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t panic! You have everything you need. Understanding the costs of a divorce means you can adjust and accommodate them. With planning and forethought, you can build a new life and find a better path.

When dividing assets and liabilities in a divorce, business debt can become a heated issue, raising questions about responsibility, ownership, and the overall financial impact on each party. In the end, determining whether both parties share liability for business debt or if they fall to just one spouse can significantly affect the financial settlement of the divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-89381 \\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business_Debt__Divorce-What_You-Need_to_Know.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022The Financial Complexities of Business Debt and Divorce\\u0022 width=\\u0022812\\u0022 height=\\u0022531\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eUnderstanding Marital vs. Separate Debt\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe first step in determining how business debt will be handled during divorce is clarifying whether it is considered marital or separate debt. The distinction between these two categories is important because it influences who will ultimately be responsible for repaying the debt.\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMarital Debt:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Generally speaking, marital debts are those incurred during the marriage, and both you and your spouse may be responsible for repayment. This may apply regardless of whose name the debt is in. For example, if business loans were taken out during the marriage to support a family-owned business, both parties may share liability.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSeparate Debt:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Debts incurred before the marriage or after separation are typically considered separate debts. If one spouse entered the marriage with existing business debt or took out a loan after filing for divorce, that debt might be treated as separate and the other spouse might not be held responsible.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nThese distinctions are subject to legal interpretation and can vary based on state laws and the terms of any prenuptial or postnuptial agreements. To explore the unique circumstances of your case, consult a top divorce attorney in your area who specializes in business assets.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCommunity Property vs. Equitable Distribution States\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe division of business debt in a divorce may also depend on whether the couple lives in a community property state or an equitable distribution state. These two legal frameworks determine how assets and liabilities are divided during a divorce.\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCommunity Property States:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Assets and debts acquired during the marriage are typically considered community property and may be split equally between both parties. This means that if business debt was accrued while the couple was married, both spouses may be responsible for half, regardless of whose name is on the loan.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eEquitable Distribution States:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Many states in the US follow equitable distribution, where assets and debts are divided fairly but not necessarily equally. In these states, factors such as each spouse's financial situation, contributions to the marriage, and the nature of the business debt may be considered when determining who is responsible and for how much. In some cases, one spouse may assume more of the business debt if they are the primary business owner.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eThe Impact of Personal Guarantees on Business Debt\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA potential complication in divorce cases involving business debt is the issue of personal guarantees. Many business owners personally guarantee loans or lines of credit for their business, which can blur the line between business and personal liability. Even if the business holds the debt, a personal guarantee can put the individual’s personal assets on the line.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eIt’s critical to consult an attorney so that you understand your financial obligations.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eNegotiating Business Debt in Divorce Settlements\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn the absence of a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, business debt will need to be negotiated as part of the divorce settlement. This can be a complex process, particularly if the business is a significant marital asset.\\r\\nIt is essential to work closely with legal and financial advisors to:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAccurately value the business:\\u003c/strong\\u003e An accurate business valuation is critical in determining how much debt each spouse is responsible for. This process includes assessing the business’s assets, liabilities, and overall financial health.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNegotiate fair terms:\\u003c/strong\\u003e If one spouse is keeping the business, they may have to assume all or most of the business debt in exchange for giving up other marital assets. Alternatively, debt may be split proportionally based on each spouse's involvement in the business.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eUnderstand how the business structure and financing activities may affect liability:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Specific activities, like co-signing for a loan, mixing personal and business accounts, and failing to formalize the business LLC or C-Corp may have implications on how business debts are viewed. It’s critical to consult an attorney so that you understand your financial obligations.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGuided Resolution\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUltimately, who’s liable for business debt will be settled through the divorce process, making it essential for both parties to have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities. Your ability to influence this will be through meticulous record keeping to show where borrowed funds are coming from and what they are being spent on, separating business and personal finances. In this way, you can provide a straightforward financial story and may be able to limit debts that you incur during your divorce.

Still, understanding the different approaches to divorce and preparing for the process ahead can help you narrow your search for the right attorney.\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eUncontested Divorce:\\u003c/strong\\u003e when you and your spouse agree on the terms of your divorce, including issues like child custody, alimony, and division of assets, your divorce is uncontested.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eContested Divorce:\\u003c/strong\\u003e When your divorce involves disputes over finances, child custody, or other important issues, it is contested and you will need to work through the differences as you move through the divorce process.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nAdditionally, if your case involves unique factors like business ownership, significant assets, or an international element, you may need a lawyer with specialized experience in these areas.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022ask\\u0022\\u003eAsk for Recommendations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nStart your search by gathering recommendations from people you trust. Friends, family members, or colleagues who have gone through a divorce may be able to provide valuable insights about their experience with their lawyers. Ask for their honest feedback on the attorney’s professionalism, communication style, and ability to handle the complexities of their case. It may also be helpful to ask why they did or did not like a certain approach to see if their preferences are the same as yours.\\r\\nBeyond personal recommendations, some online resources may be helpful. For example, DivorceLawyer.com profiles only top vetted firms in your area. Rather than endlessly scrolling through an overwhelming volume of online listings, DivorceLawyer.com takes a more educational approach to help you get to know our market-leading lawyer members, making it easier than ever to connect and go forward with confidence.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eYour divorce lawyer can be a close ally during an emotionally charged process\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022schedule\\u0022\\u003eSchedule Initial Consultations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOnce you have shortlisted potential divorce lawyers, schedule initial consultations to meet with them in person. These sessions are a great opportunity to ask questions and gauge whether they are the right fit for you. While some attorneys offer a free or lower-cost initial consultation, you should be prepared to pay the hourly rate for any appointments unless otherwise agreed in advance.\\r\\nTo get the most out of your session, be prepared to talk about your specific case and come with a list of questions to ask about their approach, such as:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat types of divorce cases do you handle – uncontested, mediation, collaborative, litigation?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat is your approach to resolving conflicts in a divorce?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHow do you handle communication and case updates?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat are the possible outcomes for my case?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nBy meeting with a few attorneys, you can compare their expertise, communication styles, and approach before making a decision.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022look\\u0022\\u003eLook for Relevant Experience\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce law is a specialized field, so it’s important to find an attorney who focuses on family law and divorce cases.

While professional expertise is critical, personal compatibility also plays an important role. At the same time you are evaluating firms, the best lawyers will also evaluate you.

When children are involved, it can prompt additional legal interventions, such as appointing a child advocate or expert who will work to ensure that the children’s best interests are prioritized. In some instances, filing for a TPO can get the ball rolling on appointing these experts.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022misusedAllegations\\u0022\\u003eFalse or Misused Allegations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUnfortunately, TPO filings are sometimes used as weapons in divorce cases. Misusing the TPO process, even unintentionally, can backfire, especially if the judge determines the allegations were exaggerated or unfounded. This misuse can severely damage a person’s credibility and the outcome of their case. Judges do not take kindly to false accusations, as they undermine the integrity of the legal process. Aside from the additional expense, reputational damage, and loss of credibility with the court, the judge can opt to have the false allegations noted in future court proceedings, which could impact the outcome of your divorce down the line.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDomestic violence adds significant complexity to divorce proceedings, requiring a thoughtful and strategic approach. Whether you are considering filing a TPO or addressing domestic violence within a divorce case, working with an experienced attorney is critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour safety and the integrity of your case depend on making informed decisions. If you are facing these challenges, seek legal advice tailored to your unique circumstances. With the right guidance, you can protect yourself and your loved ones while ensuring a fair and just resolution to your

While many couples successfully navigate this journey together, divorce is a reality for nearly half of all marriages. Some of the most common reasons people approach our firm about divorce are:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#growingApart\\u0022\\u003eGrowing Apart\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Infidelity\\u0022\\u003eInfidelity\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Finances\\u0022\\u003eFinances\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#behavioralIssues\\u0022\\u003eBehavioral Issues\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022growingApart\\u0022\\u003eGrowing Apart\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the main reasons that couples divorce is because they’ve simply grown apart. This is particularly common in a family where children are involved or something significant takes focus away from the relationship. In the case of having children, parents might find themselves devoting time and energy to their kids while growing apart in their marriage. Before you know it, you wake up and don’t recognize the relationship that you are in. You’ve both changed, and that can be hard to reconcile. When you don’t grow together through significant milestones, you might find that your lives have drifted too far apart to stay connected.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople in this situation often ask me if they should move forward with divorce. I can’t answer that question for them. The decision to divorce is deeply personal – one that only you can make. I will help you understand the road ahead, including the divorce process and potential outcomes for important topics like your future financial picture, parenting arrangements, and division of assets. If you haven’t explored marital counseling or have come to this decision in a moment of frustration, I might suggest that you hit pause, sleep on it, process the information, and then decide. If you move forward, I’ll be here to support you through the process.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThe decision to divorce is a personal one that you, and only you, can make.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Infidelity\\u0022\\u003eInfidelity\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nInfidelity is another common factor in divorce. Whether physical or emotional, it can lead to a loss of trust that can be hard to overcome. Infidelity doesn’t usually happen in a vacuum and is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as emotional neglect or dissatisfaction in the relationship. Some couples are able to rebuild their relationship after an affair, while others find it too difficult. Professional counseling or therapy may help you navigate the path to forgiveness or closure, whether that ultimately means staying together or going separate ways.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Finances\\u0022\\u003eFinancial Issues\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFinancial issues, like differences in spending habits or goals, increasing debt, or unemployment can strain any marriage. These challenges may cause feelings of inadequacy, blame, or resentment between partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome financial issues are so deep that they can be a deal breaker. For example, we see cases where one spouse gets into a financial situation that deeply impacts a couple’s financial standing, yet the other person isn’t even aware of the circumstances causing the issue. On top of the issue itself, the surprise of discovering something like this can break trust in the relationship in a way that cannot be repaired. In these cases, we will work together on a strategy to fully understand the financial picture and how you got here so that we can recommend a clear path forward.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022behavioralIssues\\u0022\\u003eBehavioral Issues\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSometimes conduct emerges in a marriage that makes one spouse feel unsafe or unwilling to live with the behavior, leading them to explore divorce. Abuse is one of those, whether it be verbal or physical. Addiction is another, and it can wreak havoc on a marriage, whether it involves alcohol, drugs, gambling, or other compulsive behaviors. For the partner of someone struggling with addiction, feelings of helplessness and resentment can be overwhelming.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a marriage, these issues often lead to financial strain, broken trust, and emotional neglect. We can advise how addiction, abuse, or other behavioral issues may affect the divorce process, including any additional safety precautions that may need to be put in place if children are involved.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhile every marriage is unique, these common reasons for divorce highlight the challenges many couples face. Addressing issues early, seeking support when needed, and maintaining open communication can help you navigate difficulties and build a stronger, more resilient relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decision to divorce is a personal one that you, and only you, can make. The last thing I am going to do is tell you to file. My role is to help you understand the process and how your life might change afterward, including things like your financial picture and child custody arrangements. I am a firm believer that you need the know the view from the other side of the fence before you can fully decide whether or not you want to divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ultimately decide to move forward with ending your marriage, it is important to be prepared for the process ahead and start to envision life after divorce. Understanding the reasons behind the separation can provide clarity and a path toward personal growth and future happiness.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of

While alimony, or spousal support, is designed to provide financial resources to a spouse post-divorce, it is not guaranteed. The amount and type of alimony may vary significantly from case to case.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most misunderstood aspects of spousal support is the concept of permanent alimony. While technically possible, it is rare, often impractical, and generally viewed as outdated in today’s legal landscape. In my experience, I have never seen a judge order lifetime alimony, though I have seen parties agree to it in settlements. This type of agreement comes with challenges, particularly when financial circumstances change over time. Key elements to understand about lifetime alimony include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Challenges\\u0022\\u003eChallenges of Lifetime Alimony\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Agreements\\u0022\\u003eAmicable Agreements May Not Remain Amicable\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#alimonyTrends\\u0022\\u003eAlimony Trends\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#alimonyCourts\\u0022\\u003eAlimony and the Courts\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-920926 size-large\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Lifelong-Alimony\\u002d\\u002d1024x573.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Lifelong Alimony\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022573\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Challenges\\u0022\\u003eChallenges of Lifetime Alimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAgreeing to lifetime alimony can create significant financial strain down the road. When you commit to paying alimony for life, you are essentially assuming responsibility for those payments through all stages of life, whether you experience a job loss, retire, or face a debilitating illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it’s possible to modify alimony arrangements, these cases are among the most difficult to win. When you request a modification, courts place a high burden of proof to demonstrate a significant change in circumstances and good faith that these factors could not be foreseen when the agreement was made. One of the most challenging aspects is addressing the argument that the paying spouse should have anticipated certain life events, such as retirement or health issues. These cases are rarely straightforward and often require extensive legal and financial documentation.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Agreements\\u0022\\u003eAmicable Agreements May Not Remain Amicable\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you settle amicably and agree to pay your spouse alimony for life, you may expect that you will continue your amicable relationship and be able to agree to make a change if your set of circumstances ever changes. That’s not always the case. Relationships sour, and the court will not necessarily be on your side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn amicable agreement to lifetime alimony may be more difficult to adjust because it was not forced upon you by the court. This eliminates the argument that it was never your intent and that you’d never enter into such an agreement because, in fact, you did. Don't think that just because the law allows for a modification, it's going to happen. Modifications are difficult.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eLifetime alimony, while technically possible, is rarely a practical or enforceable option.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022alimonyTrends\\u0022\\u003eAlimony Trends\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nToday, alimony awards are often shorter in duration or structured as a lump-sum payment. This trend reflects a shift in how courts view spousal support. In cases I’ve handled, it’s common to see alimony agreements lasting two to three years, particularly when one spouse needs time to re-enter the workforce and get back on their feet. It is unusual to see a longer-term alimony arrangement of more than eight years. The main factor really is the length of the marriage. If you have been married for 20+ years, you may be more likely to get longer-term alimony than somebody married for five years, though there are exceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother trend in high-asset cases is lump-sum alimony payments. These are often favored because they provide a clean break for both parties.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022alimonyCourts\\u0022\\u003eAlimony and the Courts\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn cases that go to court, judges tend to provide fair but limited financial support. In addition to the length of your marriage, courts assess the ability to pay and the recipient’s need. When you have a party earning in the millions, in my experience, there's going to be a greater likelihood that they will have to pay for a longer time. In cases where the higher-earning spouse has a more modest income, even if they make a lot more than their spouse, the court is going to be more reasonable in setting a shorter-term length on the alimony.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourts also assess whether the receiving spouse genuinely requires financial support. There could be a spouse who stayed home for 15 or 20 years and didn’t work. She or he might generally receive alimony. In a high asset case, the court might also recognize that though the person may not be able to earn income, they are going to be set for the rest of their life because they just got several million dollars from their division of assets. The judge might decide to shorten alimony or not award it at all.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAlimony can be a contentious issue in divorce. One of my roles as an attorney is to help clients set realistic expectations. Many people come into the divorce process with preconceived notions about what they “deserve” or what they should pay. Lifetime alimony, while technically possible, is rarely a practical or enforceable option. Instead, lawyers and the courts focus on fairness. By understanding the realities of alimony awards, you can approach negotiations with clarity and realistic expectations.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of

As a divorce attorney, I’ve seen postnuptial agreements play a pivotal role in both rebuilding trust in marriages and setting the stage for fair separations. If you are considering divorce, facing marital challenges, or have had significant changes in your financial picture since getting married, a postnup might be an option. Here are five key questions to explore:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#WhatPostnup\\u0022\\u003eWhat is a postnup? \\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#WhyPostnup\\u0022\\u003eWhy should I consider a postnup?\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#processPostnup\\u0022\\u003eWhat is the process for creating a postnup?\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#postnupsPredict\\u0022\\u003eDo postnups predict divorce?\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#modifyPostnup\\u0022\\u003eCan I modify my postnup once I agree?\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920928\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Understanding-Postnuptial\\u002d\\u002d1024x682.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Understanding Postnuptial\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022682\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022WhatPostnup\\u0022\\u003eWhat Is a Postnup?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA postnup is a contract created by spouses after you are married. Unlike a prenuptial agreement, which is signed before marriage, a postnup is often used to address issues that arise later in the relationship. It defines items like property division, alimony, and attorney’s fees, providing clarity and certainty in the event of a future divorce. While most of the big topics are covered, you cannot include child support and custody in a postnup. Those are determined based on the needs of the children at the time of divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022WhyPostnup\\u0022\\u003eWhy Should I Consider a Postnup?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCouples often turn to postnups in response to marital issues or significant financial changes as a way to rebuild trust, address financial uncertainty, or manage new financial realities.\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRebuilding Trust\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If your spouse messes up, such as through infidelity or financial misconduct, they may offer to enter into a postnuptial agreement as a way to regain trust. In doing so, they show you that they are committed to the marriage. If they mess up again, you know what you’re going to get. In these situations, a postnup can help restore security and demonstrate commitment to the relationship.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAddressing Financial Uncertainty\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If you’re unsure about the full scope of your marital finances, a postnup is a good way to learn that information. Both parties are required to disclose all assets, income, and debts during the process. This transparency is crucial if your spouse has historically handled all the finances or if you suspect hidden accounts. As information is disclosed, you will hopefully start to regain some trust.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePractical Timing\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Sometimes, postnups are just practical. If you want to get a prenup and run out of time before your wedding, you can create your postnup right after you are married. The process in these cases is more like a prenup, but with a different title because you are making the agreement after you are married.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eManaging New Financial Realities\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Significant financial changes may prompt the need for a postnup. For example, if one spouse has successfully started a business, come into a large inheritance, or experienced substantial career growth, you may want to amend an existing prenup by replacing it with a postnup to address the new change in circumstances. If you don’t have a prenup in place, you may want to consider a postnup at that point to define how these assets would be treated in a divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022processPostnup\\u0022\\u003eWhat is the Process for Creating a Postnup?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCreating a postnup involves several key steps:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFinancial Disclosure\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You and your spouse must fully disclose your financial situation. This step often takes the most time but is essential for fairness and enforceability.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNegotiating Terms\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You and your spouse will negotiate and agree on terms for the postnup. The agreements usually cover property division, alimony, and attorney’s fees.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFinalizing the Agreement\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Once both parties agree on the terms, the postnup is signed and becomes legally binding. With the postnup in place, you have some certainty if you do get divorced in the future.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022postnupsPredict\\u0022\\u003eDo Postnups Predict Divorce?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn my experience, about half of the couples I’ve worked with who create postnups eventually proceed with a divorce. For the other half, the process strengthens their marriage. A postnup often symbolizes a renewed commitment to transparency and fairness, providing a solid foundation for moving forward together.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022modifyPostnup\\u0022\\u003eCan I Modify My Postnup Once I Agree?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you already have a prenuptial agreement, a postnup can modify or supersede it to reflect new circumstances. There’s no limit to how many times a postnup can be updated, as long as both parties agree.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPostnuptial agreements are more than just legal documents—they’re a way to bring transparency and security into your marriage, address challenges, and adapt to changes in your financial picture. If you’re considering divorce but are open to exploring options to address marital challenges, a postnup could be a practical solution that helps rebuild trust and strengthen your relationship. It also offers clarity, reduces conflict, and ensures that you are protected in case the marriage ends. If you think a postnup might be right for your situation, an experienced lawyer can help you navigate the process and tailor an agreement to meet your unique needs.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of

If your circumstances have significantly changed and you are interested in updating your arrangement, it is important to understand the following:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli style=\\u0022list-style-type: none;\\u0022\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#WhatModified\\u0022\\u003eWhat Can Be Modified\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Grounds\\u0022\\u003eGrounds for Modifications\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#informalChanges\\u0022\\u003eOpportunity for Informal Changes\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920950\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-difficult-1024x573.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022How difficult\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022573\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022WhatModified\\u0022\\u003eWhat Can Be Modified?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe only things that you can modify after your divorce are alimony, child support, parenting time, and custody. Everything else is permanent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne critical point to understand is that property division is final and cannot be modified. For instance, if the marital estate was valued at $7 million and one spouse agreed to receive $3 million as part of the settlement, that decision is final. No matter how circumstances evolve, the division of property cannot be revisited. On the other hand, the amount of child support or alimony that you are paying or receiving and your child custody arrangements can be modified under certain conditions, but it is not easy.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eModifying a divorce settlement is difficult and only possible if your circumstances have significantly changed.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Grounds\\u0022\\u003eGrounds for Modification\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe law provides for modifications because we all understand that things may change. Mostly, it is a change in your financial circumstances, which consists of both your income and your overall financial state, that would warrant a modification, but there are other reasons as well. Here are some of the more common reasons:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eIncome Changes\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If you experience a significant change in income, such as losing a job, getting a promotion, or retiring, it could warrant a review. For example, if you agreed to pay significant child support and alimony based on your income as a CEO, but lose your job a few years later and your financial situation drastically changes, you could request a modification.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFinancial Circumstances\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Modifications aren’t based solely on income; they also consider overall financial health, including assets and liabilities. For instance, if you were paying alimony based on a salary of $500K per year and you retire, but you have substantial assets, the court may deny a request to reduce alimony because you still have the financial means to make payments.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eNeeds of the Children\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Child support is going to be income-driven most of the time, but may also be driven by changes in the needs of the children. If your child who previously attended public school now requires private education due to special needs, that may warrant a change in the arrangement. A modification could be made if one party is not able to afford it or wants the other party to help them pay for it.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eParental Availability\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Parenting time or custody arrangements may change if a parent’s availability shifts. This can happen for a variety of reasons, like relocation, illness, or other life changes. The court always prioritizes the child’s best interests in these cases.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022informalChanges\\u0022\\u003eOpportunity for Informal Changes\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFormal modifications to the divorce agreement are not the only way to implement the changes you need. If your circumstances have changed and both parties agree to make accommodations, you can absolutely agree on your own to a new arrangement without going back to court.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nModifying a divorce settlement is difficult and only possible if circumstances have significantly changed. While alimony, child support, parenting time, and custody can be modified, division of property cannot. Modifications are not automatic and must be substantiated with clear evidence of a significant change in things like your income, overall financial picture, the needs of your children, or parental availability. Whether you pursue a formal modification through the courts or reach an informal agreement with your ex-spouse, it’s essential to prioritize clarity, fairness, and the best interests of everyone involved, particularly children.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"What Can Be Modified\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#WhatModified\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Grounds for Modifications\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#Grounds\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Opportunity for Informal Changes\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#informalChanges\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":3,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Marvin Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/marvin-solomiany/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

These assets are not easily or quickly converted into cash, and their value can be challenging to predict. Additionally, selling non-liquid assets may result in a significant loss of value, making their division more complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nDividing these assets involves several key steps: determining their value, assessing how much of that value is marital, and deciding how to equitably distribute or offset the marital share. Often, one spouse retains ownership of a non-liquid asset by compensating the other with a payout plan or through an exchange of other marital assets. Contrary to popular belief, immediate liquidation of assets–”fire sales\\u0022– is rare. It is important to focus on the larger ticket items, rather than spending too much time on lower-valued items.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome things to consider when dividing non-liquid assets are:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#prioritizing\\u0022\\u003ePrioritizing Your Interests\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#valuation\\u0022\\u003eValuation of Assets\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#appraisals\\u0022\\u003eAppraisals and Differing Opinions\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#exchanging\\u0022\\u003eExchanging Assets\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#personalEffects\\u0022\\u003ePersonal Effects\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920952\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Dividing-Non-Liquid-Assets\\u002d\\u002d1024x576.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Dividing Non-Liquid Assets\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022576\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022prioritizing\\u0022\\u003ePrioritizing Your Interests\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen thinking about how to divide assets, one effective strategy is to make a comprehensive list of the marital assets and identify which items you value most. We then reconcile the list with what the other person wants. Often, couples find that they agree on the majority of items, significantly narrowing the scope of disputes. Out of a hundred items, you may only be fighting about three, and we can come up with a mechanism to resolve those issues. Interestingly, many individuals don’t want to keep possessions that carry negative memories. You’d be surprised how often one party says, “I don’t care. Let them keep it.” By determining where you agree on who gets what, and focusing only on these few contentious items, couples can save time, energy, and money.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThe last thing that you want to do is to pay attorneys to divide the pots and pans.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022valuation\\u0022\\u003eValuation of Assets\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nYou can't divide anything until you have an idea of value, so that is always the first step in the process. Once you determine value, you have to assess how much of that value is marital, meaning how much of the value was attained during your marriage and is subject to division. Depending on the asset, we may rely on financial experts, like a business valuation expert, or have an item appraised.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022appraisals\\u0022\\u003eAppraisals and Differing Opinions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFor higher-value items like real estate, art, or antiques, appraisals can become a sticking point. Disputes often arise when expert appraisers provide widely differing valuations, making it difficult to determine a fair division. In one recent case, a couple was disputing a lake house, with real estate experts nearly $1 million apart in estimated value. The judge couldn’t reconcile it and ultimately resolved the issue by ordering the property sold, using the sale price as the true fair market value. While this approach may not be ideal for everyone, it provides a definitive resolution when agreement isn’t possible.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022exchanging\\u0022\\u003eExchanging Assets\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIt is very unlikely that both spouses are going to continue to have an ongoing interest in each asset. Once you have determined the value of the marital estate assets, you can split them. It doesn't have to be the same asset that you're transferring – you can trade another asset to satisfy your spouse’s interest. For example, you might trade the value of your retirement account for the marital value of the family business. If there are no assets to trade, you can offer a lump sum payout or payout stream over a period of time to satisfy that interest.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022personalEffects\\u0022\\u003ePersonal Effects\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen considering non-liquid assets, most personal effects, like clothing, will not be included. If you have unique assets with significant value, like a million-dollar wine collection, that will likely go on the balance sheet, while personal items like engagement rings may be excluded if they were exchanged before you were married. Ultimately, couples are advised to amicably resolve disputes about minor assets. Litigation over personal effects can be costly and inefficient. The last thing that you want to do is to pay attorneys to divide the pots and pans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we won’t focus on every small item, we will consider the replacement value of items, such as the other spouse keeping all the furniture. If you are left with no furniture, you have to consider how much it is going to cost you to go out and replace it. You’ll both need furniture. If neither spouse is interested in specific assets, they can be sold. However, selling items can come with a financial caveat. The resale value of personal property is often significantly lower than its original price, sometimes cents on the dollar.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDividing non-liquid assets during a divorce can be a complex process, but with careful planning, clear priorities, and open communication, it is possible to achieve a fair and equitable resolution. By focusing on accurate valuation, leveraging expert appraisals, and seeking creative solutions such as asset exchanges or payout plans, couples can address even the most challenging assets.

When a family business is involved, the stakes—and the complications—can be even higher. For couples who own and operate a closely held business during their marriage, the business often represents not only a source of income but also years of shared effort and investment. Understanding how a family business impacts divorce is essential for safeguarding both personal and professional interests. As we move through the divorce process, some of the things we’ll need to work through include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli style=\\u0022list-style-type: none;\\u0022\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#confirmingOwnership\\u0022\\u003eConfirming Ownership Interest\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#reviewingBusiness\\u0022\\u003eReviewing Business vs. Marital Assets\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#assessingValue\\u0022\\u003eAssessing the Value of the Business\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920954\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Impact-of-Family-Businesses\\u002d\\u002d1024x684.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Impact of Family Businesses\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022684\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022confirmingOwnership\\u0022\\u003eConfirming Ownership Interest\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen assessing the impact of a family-owned business on divorce, the first thing we need to establish is that we have a good understanding of the ownership structure. Often what people perceive their ownership interest to be is not necessarily consistent with what the actual documents show. For example, a spouse believes that they own 25% or 50% of a business. When we start looking at the operating agreement or shareholders’ agreement, we discover that the spouse’s interest was never formally documented. The spouse may still be entitled to part of the business (or its value) in the divorce, but determining that split will take some extra effort. Confirming true ownership interest is an important step.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eIn most situations, there’s going to be a marital component to your business asset.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022reviewingBusiness\\u0022\\u003eReviewing Business vs. Marital Assets\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn closely held businesses, there is often a lot of overlap between personal and business finances. To accurately assess the marital estate, we will need to review your business assets and liabilities in detail. Assets tied to the business or excluded from your personal tax filings may still be considered part of the marital estate. For example, if the business is paying for things like cars or a vacation home, those could potentially be included in the division of assets. If we find that an asset like a car is owned by the business, but primarily used by the spouse who is not involved in the business, we will try to transfer that asset to the appropriate spouse after the divorce. Thoroughly reviewing business records is key to ensuring that nothing is overlooked in the division process.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022assessingValue\\u0022\\u003eAssessing the Value of the Business\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe family business is an asset, just like the marital residence, and we will need to establish its value. To do this, we typically bring in a business valuation expert who can give us an estimated range of what the business is worth. There may also be marital and pre-marital components to consider. Even if the business is inherited or started pre-marriage, appreciation during the marriage is still going to be relevant to the divorce. In that case, we would assess the value as close to the start of the marriage as possible, and then assess the value today to understand how that’s changed. While there would be a separate, pre-marital component, the value of the appreciation would be part of the marital assets subject to division.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA family business can make divorce significantly more complex, but with proper legal guidance, it’s possible to reach an equitable resolution.

It is common for one spouse to be more knowledgeable than the other. If you are not involved in managing your finances, it’s perfectly fine to ask your spouse about them. Be honest. If they’ve kept you in the dark, ask them to sit down with you and explain.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Disclosure\\u0022\\u003eProvide Full Disclosure\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe last people you want to lie to are your attorney and the judge. I encourage my clients to tell me everything, from conduct to financials. It's almost impossible to hide assets. If it's hidden, we'll find it. If incorrect transactions have been made, now is a good time to correct them and we can guide you on the best way to do that. I would rather have all the information ahead of time because my advice is obviously based on that information. If you're not telling me something, then my advice may not be accurate.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eOnce you file for divorce, try your very best to continue to live the same financial life as before you filed.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022majorTransactions\\u0022\\u003eLimit Major Transactions Once You File\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nNeither you nor your spouse should unnecessarily spend money or move financial assets just because you are going through a divorce, especially if it is with the intent to reduce your marital estate. As a general rule, once you file for divorce, don’t engage in transactions outside of the ordinary course of family business, and don’t transfer assets. If this happens, we're going to find out sooner or later as we go through the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also challenge any unusual transactions that happened ahead of the divorce if we suspect that they were made in anticipation of filing. For example, if someone transferred, say, a million dollars to their brother, we might challenge that.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022financialStatus\\u0022\\u003eMaintain the Financial Status Quo\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOnce you file for divorce, try your very best to continue to live the same financial life as before you filed. Basically, just keep doing what you're doing, and don’t do anything crazy. I can't undo in a day what you and your husband or wife have done in 15 years. You will need to try to maintain your financial status quo as much as possible while we work through the divorce process.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen clients seek my advice on divorce, safeguarding their financial interests is often a top concern. Doing so requires preparation, knowledge, and professional support.

Divorce can take a toll on both your emotions and your physical well-being. Prioritize self-care by eating well, staying active, and getting enough rest. Engage in activities that help you manage stress, whether it’s yoga, exercise, or simply taking a walk to clear your mind.\\r\\nMental health is equally important. Consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Having a safe space to express your feelings can make a significant difference.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eAs painful and traumatic as divorce can be, it’s important to remind yourself that it’s a phase of life—not the entirety of it.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022seekPositive\\u0022\\u003eSeek Positive Outlets\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSurround yourself with a positive support network. Friends, family, and trusted mentors can offer perspective, comfort, and guidance during this time. If you’re involved in church, community groups, or other social networks, lean into those connections.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, divorce is not a journey you have to navigate alone. Let those close to you know how they can help, whether that’s lending a listening ear, offering practical assistance, or simply providing companionship during difficult moments.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022avoidLetting\\u0022\\u003eAvoid Letting Divorce Consume Your Identity\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the biggest pitfalls I’ve seen is when the divorce process becomes someone’s sole focus – their entire identity or life. It’s all they think about and work on every day. I don’t think that’s healthy. While it’s natural for divorce to take up a significant portion of your energy, it is important to continue engaging in and focusing on the other aspects of life around you. Make time for the things that bring you joy or remind you of your individuality outside the divorce. Whether it’s hobbies, career aspirations, or future goals, focusing on these areas can help you move forward.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022maintainPerspective\\u0022\\u003eMaintain Perspective\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAs painful and traumatic as divorce can be, it’s important to remind yourself that it’s a phase of life—not the entirety of it. Life will continue beyond this chapter, and keeping that perspective is crucial. Maintaining a long-term view can help you make decisions that will serve your best interests in the future. Practicing mindfulness, journaling, or talking with a therapist can help you stay grounded and focused on what truly matters.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is a difficult process, but it doesn’t have to define you. By taking care of your health, leaning on your support system, refusing to let the divorce consume you, and keeping a forward-looking perspective, you can navigate this challenge with resilience. Remember, life will go on. This is just one chapter—it doesn’t dictate the rest of your story. With the right legal and emotional support, you can emerge stronger and ready to embrace the next phase of your life.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Be Mindful of Your Physical and Mental Health\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#beMindful\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Seek Positive Outlets\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#seekPositive\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Avoid Letting Divorce Consume Your Identity\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#avoidLetting\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Maintain Perspective\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#maintainPerspective\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Jonathan Tuggle \",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/jonathan-tuggle/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Boyd Collar Nolen Tuggle \\u0026 Roddenbery Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Divorce is inherently emotional, and disagreements often feel personal and overwhelming. One of the most challenging aspects of guiding clients through their divorce is helping them manage conflict. Effectively resolving conflict can lead to quicker settlements, reduced stress, and lower costs.

Transparency is critical. Early in the divorce process, you have an opportunity to establish credibility, and you get one shot at it. In your average case, there's going to be some amount of discovery conducted. It’s all going to come out. If the other side's lawyer discovers that you have concealed something, it casts a shadow of doubt over everything that you represent and seemingly validates suspicions. If their lawyer is doing their job, they now have an elevated duty of due diligence because they can't accept your word. This loss of trust will likely fuel deeper scrutiny, intensify disputes, and increase both time and costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, when respect and trust are maintained, divorce becomes more transactional. If you are open and honest about finances, parenting plans, and other issues, you can focus on dividing assets, negotiating custody schedules, and moving forward.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eFacing the complexities of divorce requires a combination of emotional resilience and effective conflict resolution.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022manageEmotions\\u0022\\u003eManage Emotions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is a deeply emotional experience, but letting your emotions take over can hinder your progress. Sadly, the parties are divorcing, but if they can maintain some level of respect, you're probably getting out of there with a 50/50 deal and some reasonable custody arrangement. In contrast, when somebody has crossed a line and deeply betrayed trust, it may be tempting to bring that up throughout the process. Rehashing every transgression in the marriage, for example, may escalate tension without adding much value to your case. You’re just stoking the fire. Instead, consider whether the behavior or issue at hand has a tangible impact, such as financial waste or custody implications. You should be open and honest, but try not to engage on an emotional level. Emotions are already running high enough.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022professionalSupport\\u0022\\u003eSeek Mental Health Support\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is as much an emotional journey as it is a legal one. If unresolved or unmanaged emotions are clouding your judgment or preventing you from thinking clearly, counseling can be invaluable. Your physical and mental health is critical in your ability to make decisions, be solution-oriented, and focus on the practical aspects of your case. A therapist can help you process feelings of anger, sadness, or betrayal, empower you to approach the divorce with a clearer mind, and help position you for the next stage of your life.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022leverageMediation\\u0022\\u003eLeverage Mediation or Arbitration\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMediation is a valuable tool for resolving conflict. In many states, courts require mediation before proceeding to trial. This process encourages both parties to work collaboratively toward an agreement and often leads to faster resolutions than litigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those seeking more privacy or control, arbitration or private trial is another option. Unlike mediation, where either party can walk away at any time, arbitration leads to a binding decision made by a neutral third party. This can be a valuable middle ground for couples who cannot resolve their differences in mediation or want to avoid the public nature of a courtroom trial and would appreciate a less formal setting.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFacing the complexities of divorce requires a combination of emotional resilience and effective conflict resolution. Embracing the principles of transparency, respect, and practical problem-solving can reduce animosity and protect your financial interests. Maintaining trust, managing emotions, seeking professional support, and leveraging tools like mediation or arbitration can help you approach the process with clarity and focus. While divorce is inherently challenging, resolving conflicts productively can pave the way for a smoother, less costly experience, allowing you to move forward with your life.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Maintain Trust\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#maintainTrust\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Manage Emotions\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#manageEmotions\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Seek Professional Support\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#professionalSupport\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Leverage Mediation or Arbitration\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#leverageMediation\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Jonathan Tuggle \",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/jonathan-tuggle/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Boyd Collar Nolen Tuggle \\u0026 Roddenbery Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

While each case is unique, several factors consistently influence the cost of divorce. Understanding these variables can help you navigate the process more effectively and avoid unnecessary expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920963\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Three-Factors\\u002d\\u002d1024x682.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Three Factors\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022682\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are three things that often impact the cost of divorce:\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Expectations\\u0022\\u003e1. Expectations of the Parties\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUnrealistic expectations are a significant factor in driving up the cost of divorce. For instance, a spouse who refuses to accept an equitable distribution of assets, significantly undervalues a family-owned business, or demands exorbitant alimony amounts can derail negotiations and push the case toward costly litigation. Expectations can change, so it is important to continue pre-trial negotiations to see if you reach a fair settlement—or one that you can live with.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Reasonableness\\u0022\\u003e2. Reasonableness of the Parties\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nHow cooperative—or combative—each spouse is can significantly affect the cost of divorce. If one or both parties are unwilling to compromise or insist on fighting over every detail, the legal fees and emotional toll can quickly escalate. Emotional disputes, particularly over children or finances, often prolong the process and make it more expensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain behaviors, often rooted in emotion, can unnecessarily increase costs. These include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eFighting for the sake of fighting. For example, when a non-primary caregiver demands full custody just to hurt their spouse emotionally.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTaking rigid or illogical positions. For example, your spouse takes a position that just doesn’t make sense, like wanting 90% of all assets.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nIf you find yourself on the receiving end of negotiating with an unreasonable spouse, taking them to court may be necessary. Judges often provide a much-needed reality check, particularly during temporary hearings where initial rulings set expectations. It might be hard, but sometimes you have to ignore the noise and let the judge and courts play their role.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eDivorce is rarely simple, but understanding the factors that drive up costs can make the process less overwhelming.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022attorneysInvolved\\u0022\\u003e3. The Attorneys Involved\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nNot all attorneys approach divorce the same way. Most prioritize their clients' best interests, offering reasonable solutions that weigh the costs and benefits of major decisions. Others may prolong disputes, which increases fees. When choosing a divorce lawyer, it’s essential to find someone that will pursue negotiation where possible, and litigation when needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome signs that your attorney is working in your best interest include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eProviding a clear cost-benefit analysis to help you make decisions. For example, if you are considering going to trial and the trial will cost $100,000, you have to consider what you stand to gain. If your disagreement over finances with your spouse is $150,000, litigation may not be worth it. If the potential gain far outweighs the cost of litigation–say recovering $500,000–pursuing litigation might make sense.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eHelping you navigate emotional burnout. While the average divorce process can take a year or longer, I notice that most clients start to feel the strain of the process after eight to ten months. This is often when fatigue sets in, leading some people to want to settle for less favorable terms just to get it over with.

The uncertainty of what life will look like post-divorce can feel overwhelming. Many clients express anxiety about how their future will unfold, from financial stability to co-parenting arrangements. This fear can lead them to pause and question whether ending the marriage is the right choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some, this fear is rooted in a codependent relationship dynamic. They’re scared of being alone or starting over without their partner. The prospect of losing the security of a familiar relationship, even one that isn’t ideal, can make people decide to stick it out instead of leaping into the unknown.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022drivingDivorce\\u0022\\u003eWho’s Driving Divorce\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn many cases, divorce isn’t a shared desire but the result of one partner driving the process. If that person changes their mind, you might not go through with it. Often, if the other person hasn’t reached the same conclusion that divorce is necessary, they may be holding on to hope for reconciliation and could welcome the pause as a chance to work on the relationship.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022underlyingIssues\\u0022\\u003eAddressing Underlying Issues\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFor couples who change their minds, the decision often hinges on whether their issues are truly irreparable. If your problems can be addressed in marriage counseling or a marriage retreat, you should not be considering divorce as your only solution. Problems like poor communication, lack of quality time, or differing parenting styles can frequently be resolved with support and effort. I often recommend these options to clients who aren’t facing more severe issues, such as abuse or infidelity.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022stayingTogether\\u0022\\u003eStaying Together for the Kids\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the biggest myths I encounter is the idea of staying together for the benefit of the children. In reality, this often does more harm than good. By staying in a dysfunctional marriage, parents risk modeling unhealthy relationship dynamics for their children. In these cases, divorce can provide an opportunity to create a healthier environment for everyone involved.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022prolongingNecessary\\u0022\\u003eProlonging a Necessary Decision\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSometimes when people reconsider divorce, it’s a temporary interruption rather than a permanent resolution. While some couples use this time to address issues and repair their relationship, others find themselves back in my office months or years later. The underlying problems that led them to consider divorce often resurface if they haven’t been fully resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor couples dealing with extreme issues like verbal, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, there is often a tipping point. Those who pause to address these often return to the idea of divorce after a defining moment when the behavior doesn’t change, and they just can’t take it anymore. These moments underscore the importance of self-respect and safety in making the decision to divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Thoughts\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nChanging your mind about divorce is not unusual, but it’s essential to approach the decision thoughtfully. Whether you are reconsidering for fear of the unknown or out of a genuine desire to repair your relationship, take the time to address the underlying issues when reasonable. Marriage counseling, open communication, and personal reflection can help you determine whether your marriage is worth saving or if divorce is the right path forward.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Fear of Being Alone\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#fearAlone\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Who’s Driving Divorce\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#drivingDivorce\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Addressing Underlying Issues\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#underlyingIssues\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Staying Together for the Kids\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#stayingTogether\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Prolonging a Necessary Decision\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#prolongingNecessary\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":5,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

While some of the reasons are understandable, even necessary, others make me shake my head and wonder if the marriage could be saved with a little effort and introspection. Divorce is a major decision with lasting consequences, not something to pursue lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920969\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Six-of-the-Worst-Reasons\\u002d\\u002d1024x540.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Six of the Worst Reasons\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022540\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some of the worst reasons to get divorced and why counseling might be a better first step.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022qualityTime \\u0022\\u003e1. Lack of Quality Time Together\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the most common issues I see is couples who simply aren’t spending enough time together. Life gets busy with work, kids, and responsibilities, and the relationship falls by the wayside. Instead of turning to divorce, consider prioritizing time for each other. Plan regular date nights, hire a babysitter, or set aside time to reconnect. Often, the lack of quality time can be remedied with effort and intention, breathing new life into the marriage.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022poorCommunication\\u0022\\u003e2. Poor Communication\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCommunication issues are at the heart of many troubled marriages. Couples often misunderstand each other or fail to express their feelings effectively. While poor communication can lead to significant frustration, it’s often a solvable problem. A marriage counselor can provide tools and strategies to help couples communicate better, resolve conflicts, and understand each other’s perspectives.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eI don’t promote divorce. I simply help people navigate the process when it’s the best course of action.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Disagreements\\u0022\\u003e3. Financial Disagreements\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMoney is a common source of tension in relationships, but it’s rarely a reason to give up on a marriage. Disagreements about finances, spending habits, or saving priorities can often be addressed through open discussions or financial counseling. Educating yourself about your finances and building a joint plan for managing money can reduce stress and help couples work together toward shared goals.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022parentingStyles\\u0022\\u003e4. Differences in Parenting Styles\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMany couples struggle with disagreements over how to raise or discipline their children. While these differences can create tension, they don’t have to lead to divorce. A family therapist or parenting coach can help couples find common ground and create a consistent approach to parenting that works for everyone involved.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022unmetExpectations\\u0022\\u003e5. Unmet Expectations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUnrealistic or unmet expectations about marriage can leave people feeling disillusioned. Many of these issues stem from a lack of communication or understanding about each other’s needs. Instead of seeking a divorce, couples can work on resetting expectations, expressing their desires clearly, and finding ways to meet each other halfway.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022healthyMarriage\\u0022\\u003e6. No Frame of Reference for a Healthy Marriage\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSome couples lack a frame of reference for how a healthy relationship looks. With today's high divorce rate, it is not uncommon for individuals to come from families where both parents are divorced and to watch friends separate after seemingly perfect marriages on social media. It is important to seek out healthy role models or a support structure that can help you create your own vision of a strong partnership. Without these positive examples, a lack of guidance, combined with low self-esteem or lack of confidence, can lead people to view divorce as the only option. In reality, the relationship might be salvageable with support and effort.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nI don’t promote divorce. I simply help people navigate the process when it’s the best course of action. Before you walk into a divorce lawyer’s office, ask yourself if you’ve truly explored all avenues for saving your marriage. In many cases, counseling can address the underlying issues and help you repair your marriage before it gets that far. Whether it’s improving communication, resolving financial disputes, or reconnecting emotionally, therapy offers tools to strengthen relationships and avoid the pain and expense of divorce.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Lack of Quality Time Together\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#qualityTime \",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Poor Communication\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#poorCommunication\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Financial Disagreements\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#Disagreements\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Differences in Parenting Styles\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#parentingStyles\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Unmet Expectations\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#unmetExpectations\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_5_title\":\"No Frame of Reference for a Healthy Marriage\",\"_contents_list_5_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_5_link_id\":\"#healthyMarriage\",\"_contents_list_5_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":6,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

The way you tell a 14-year-old could be very different from how you would approach a young child. You may also need to consider special circumstances for a child with developmental support needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour children may already be aware that there are challenges in your relationship. Sometimes kids will surprise you and be the ones to point out that it’s time to go ahead and get divorced because they can’t stand the ongoing arguments. Speaking with children who have this point of view will be quite different from sharing the news with a child who isn’t expecting the conversation. In all cases, it is important to consider the specific needs of your child as you make a plan with your spouse.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022mentalHealth\\u0022\\u003eSeek Mental Health Resources\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nI am an experienced lawyer, but I am not a therapist. I encourage clients to seek support from mental health professionals whose areas of expertise relate to children. We rely heavily on a network of professionals like psychologists and other therapists to help us navigate the process of supporting children through divorce. I also recommend books that may serve as a guide for parents, such as Divorce: The Art of Screwing Up Your Children by psychologist Howard Drutman.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eChildren should not be made to feel like they have to choose sides.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022unitedFront\\u0022\\u003eCreate a United Front\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIdeally, both parents will be together when they share the news about their divorce with their children. When one parent shares the news on their own, it creates a riff. The parent who was not involved will feel left out and assume, accurately or not, that the parent who delivered the news is trying to sway the children to favor them. It can also leave the children feeling like they have to pick a side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppearances matter in the eyes of children. The more amicable you can keep it in front of them, even if it’s not amicable behind the scenes, the better it will be for the children in the long run. It will also set the stage for how you will navigate your future, as you continue to interact with your former spouse and parent together through drop-offs, school functions, holidays, and other events in your children’s lives.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022keyMessages\\u0022\\u003eReassure with Key Messages\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen you sit down with your children to share the news, there are some key messages that you will want to be prepared to communicate. Keep the language simple, honest, and neutral, without blaming each other. Be prepared to say, “We’re getting a divorce.” As you move through the conversation, be honest that it’s going to require some changes. Listen and be open to any questions that your children might have.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile talking about change, you’ll also want to reaffirm that, “We still love you, we’re still here for you, and we’re going to do our best to make this as amicable as possible.” Children should not be made to feel like they have to choose sides. They still have two parents, and you want to reinforce that.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022childSafety\\u0022\\u003ePrioritize Child Safety\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThere are exceptions when a united front might not be possible. In some cases, there may be conduct issues, like physical abuse or drug addiction, that have the potential to impact the children. At that point, the most important thing is to make sure that the children are protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nA parent who is struggling with addiction or mental health may perceive that their actions are perfectly normal, and they may hold onto the belief that they would never hurt their kids, even if they already are. They might be unable to control their own actions or even realize that they need help. We need to make sure that the other spouse is able to protect the children until we can get some type of court order in place governing what limitations, if any, the parent might have with the children or what safeguards might be put in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome recommendations in these cases could be things like not leaving your children with the other parent for an extended period of time or, where addiction is an issue, not allowing the children to ride in a car when the parent is driving. The safety of your children is the priority.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce can be a challenging time for any family. When kids are involved, telling your children can be daunting. How parents communicate this transition can significantly affect their children’s emotional well-being. While every family is unique, the goal should be to provide clarity, reassurance, and stability during a time of change. How you handle this conversation with your children can set the tone for how they process the change and can create the foundation for a positive future.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Consider the Children’s Needs\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#childrenNeeds\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Seek Mental Health Resources\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#mentalHealth\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Reassure with Key Messages\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#keyMessages\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Create a United Front\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#unitedFront\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Prioritize Child Safety\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#childSafety\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":5,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Marvin Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/marvin-solomiany/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Requirements vary by state and also depend on whether your divorce is contested or not. While uncontested divorces can be settled in as little as a month, that’s not typical. Timeframes can also change as spouses realize that they can’t agree on key points, requiring more negotiation. Where there are extensive or complicated assets involved or where a spouse is unwilling to compromise, the process may extend beyond a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome important elements of the legal timeline include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#waitingPeriod\\u0022\\u003eWaiting Period\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#residencyRequirement\\u0022\\u003eResidency Requirement\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#gettingPrepared\\u0022\\u003eGetting Prepared While You Wait\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920981\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Waiting-Period-to-Get-Divorced-1024x682.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Waiting Period to Get Divorced\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022682\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022waitingPeriod\\u0022\\u003eWaiting Period\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSome states require a waiting period before a divorce can be filed or finalized. Some even require a level of counseling or actual physical separation before you can file for divorce. In Georgia, there is no waiting period to file, but, once you file, the state requires a 30-day waiting period.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour divorce will likely take longer than a month. That short of a turnaround is very unusual and only happens when the divorce is truly uncontested. You would need to come to me with an agreement where all of the issues are resolved, including key topics like your division of assets, alimony, and child custody. In that situation, we can get the divorce quickly drafted and filed, but that only happens in a limited number of cases.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eWhile waiting can be frustrating, it’s also an opportunity to prepare yourself by gaining knowledge about your financial picture and starting to plan the next chapter of your life.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022residencyRequirement\\u0022\\u003eResidency Requirement\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn addition to any waiting periods for filing or finalizing your divorce, you may face a state residency requirement to start the process. Establishing residency typically has its own timeline, depending on where you live. In Georgia, it takes six months to establish residency and you must be a resident before you can file for divorce. You typically can’t just move to a new state and then file, so you’ll want to factor that into your timeline.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022gettingPrepared\\u0022\\u003eGetting Prepared While You Wait\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhether you are in the waiting period or just starting to think about divorce, the pre-divorce filing time is an important window to get your ducks in a row. During this period, make sure that you have access to all household financial information. This includes getting an idea of your current budget, understanding your financial assets and liabilities, and educating yourself on things like your income, expenses, savings, and asset location.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are not involved in managing your finances, it’s perfectly fine to ask your spouse about them. Be honest. If they’ve kept you in the dark, ask them to sit down with you and explain your assets, income, and liabilities. Getting a clear picture of those things during the time that you're waiting is so important because it gives us a head start, as opposed to filing without financial details and trying to piece information together afterward.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThere is often a waiting period to get divorced, but the specifics depend on your state and situation. While waiting can be frustrating, it’s also an opportunity to prepare yourself by gaining knowledge about your financial picture and starting to plan the next chapter of your life. By understanding the requirements and working with an experienced attorney, you can navigate the divorce process with greater ease and peace of mind.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Waiting Period\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#waitingPeriod\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Residency Requirement\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#residencyRequirement\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Getting Prepared While You Wait\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#gettingPrepared\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":3,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Marvin Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/marvin-solomiany/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

While guidelines may vary from state to state, courts generally employ a three-pronged “test” to determine whether a prenuptial agreement will hold up during divorce proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re facing divorce where a prenup is in place, understanding these three factors can provide clarity on the degree of enforceability:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli style=\\u0022list-style-type: none;\\u0022\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#fullDisclosure\\u0022\\u003eFull Disclosure of Assets, Liabilities, and Income\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Unconscionability\\u0022\\u003eUnconscionability\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#significantChanges\\u0022\\u003eSignificant Changes in Circumstances\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920983\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Prenuptial-Agreements\\u002d\\u002d1024x682.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Prenuptial Agreements\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022682\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e1. Full Disclosure of Assets, Liabilities, and Income\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe first and most important factor is whether both spouses fully disclosed all financial information at the time the prenuptial agreement was executed. This includes sharing information about all assets, liabilities, and income transparently and accurately. A lack of full disclosure can lead to allegations of fraud that can invalidate a prenup if one party was misled, or did not have all the necessary information to make an informed decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, if you discover during your divorce that your spouse failed to list a substantial asset or understated their income at the time of the prenup, the agreement may be called into question. Courts take this requirement very seriously because it ensures that both parties entered into the agreement with their eyes wide open. If a party can prove that the other concealed significant financial details, the agreement is more likely to be contested and potentially deemed unenforceable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, this is the most frequently contested aspect of prenups. However, agreements with clear, documented financial disclosures typically withstand scrutiny.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eWhile no prenup is immune to challenges, generally speaking, prenuptial agreements do hold up, provided they meet the legal requirements of full disclosure and fairness.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e2. Unconscionability\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe second factor to determine enforceability is whether the agreement is unconscionable. It’s important to note that an agreement being “unfair” does not necessarily render it unconscionable. Most prenuptial agreements are going to be viewed as unfair, but unconscionable rises to the level that is so one-sided or oppressive that no reasonable or sane person would have ever signed it. This is a high legal standard to meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost prenuptial agreements inherently have some level of imbalance, but that alone does not make them unenforceable. The courts look for extreme situations—such as agreements that leave one party destitute or disproportionately enrich the other—to determine whether unconscionability applies. It is rare for a court to strike down a prenup on these grounds.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e3. Significant Changes in Circumstances\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe third prong of the test evaluates whether the facts and circumstances of your marriage have changed so significantly since the agreement was signed that enforcing it would be unfair at the time of divorce. This sounds easier to prove than it actually is because it requires evidence of drastic and unforeseen changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples might include a spouse developing a severe disability or medical condition that prevents them from supporting themselves after the divorce. These scenarios are exceptional, and I’ve only seen a handful of cases succeed on these grounds. For instance, if a spouse becomes incapacitated and enforcing the original terms of the agreement would result in undue hardship, the courts might reconsider its enforceability. Minor or predictable changes in circumstances are unlikely to meet this threshold.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPrenuptial agreements can provide clarity and protection as you enter marriage, but their enforceability hinges on key legal principles. While no prenup is immune to challenges, generally speaking, prenuptial agreements do hold up, provided they meet the legal requirements of full disclosure and fairness. Typically, the most important factor is whether all of the assets, liabilities, and income were disclosed. With that disclosure, the prenup will likely hold up and can offer a strong level of legal protection and predictability.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Full Disclosure of Assets, Liabilities, and Income\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#fullDisclosure\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Unconscionability\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#Unconscionability\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Significant Changes in Circumstances\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#significantChanges\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":3,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Marvin Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/marvin-solomiany/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

While most settle, the idea of going to court can feel overwhelming. Knowing how a judge might approach your case can be a helpful barometer of your willingness to negotiate. In this way, the role of the judge extends beyond hearings; it also shapes how cases can be resolved outside of court. We typically prepare for war to get peace, helping you understand what to expect if you don't settle and crafting agreements that reflect your needs and priorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor cases that do reach court, preparation involves anticipating the judge's expectations and providing practical solutions to simplify their decision-making.

While the reality is that most cases never make it to court, trial preparation shapes negotiations. We focus on building a strong case that can also support effective negotiation. This means understanding the judge’s likely perspective and presenting solutions that align with their priorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne key aspect of negotiation is recognizing the personal dynamics at play. Divorce is deeply emotional, and reaching a settlement often requires addressing the concerns of both parties. Sometimes, getting the outcome you want involves looking for strategic ways to say yes where compromise is possible, letting the other side feel like they are winning, or helping your spouse save face. Clients have to help me learn to read their spouse and negotiate with them because we probably aren’t going to get to court. With this knowledge, I can leverage their priorities, like protecting their reputation or ensuring the children’s well-being, to help them understand what’s at stake and motivate them to settle. By crafting offers that consider both legal outcomes and practical needs, we create a foundation for agreement.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022assessingFairness\\u0022\\u003eAssessing Fairness\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen clients ask me about fairness, they really want to know what I believe a judge would decide based on my experience, knowledge of the judge, understanding of divorce law, and the specific circumstances of their case. In this sense, the court serves as a reality check, providing a framework for evaluating what might be reasonable in your case. Knowing what a court will do is really important not only so that we can prepare for the possibility of going to trial, but also to help you know what to accept or offer in a settlement.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eDivorce is deeply personal. With the right strategy, you can create the best possible outcome.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022priorities\\u0022\\u003eThe Judge’s Priorities\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf your case does go to court, understanding what judges care about is crucial. Unlike other areas of law, family law focuses on the present and the future, not the distant past. Judges will not be concerned with who parented your fifteen-year-old when they were two; they want to know what is happening now and how the proposed solutions will benefit the children and the parties involved moving forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, in custody cases, a judge evaluates the current parenting arrangement and whether it serves the child’s best interests. It can be easier to convince the judge to agree to the outcome you want if it is already in place and working. If you’re consistently demonstrating that you’re an engaged and supportive parent who works hard to involve the other parent, the judge is more likely to endorse your role in the child’s life. Similarly, presenting a well-thought-out financial plan can simplify the judge’s decision-making process, increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022presentingSolutions\\u0022\\u003ePresenting Solutions, Not Problems\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nJudges appreciate when attorneys bring solutions to the table instead of just highlighting problems. My goal is always to make the judge’s job easier. For instance, if there’s a dispute over attorney’s fees, I might propose a temporary solution, like using a portion of the marital estate to cover costs until the case is resolved. This approach shows the judge that we’re prepared, reasonable, and focused on resolving the case efficiently. Making the judge’s life easier by solving problems before we get to court can go a long way to getting the outcome you want.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022legalExpertise\\u0022\\u003eThe Value of Legal Expertise\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThere is real value in having an attorney who understands the judge’s preferences and tendencies. You might be worried about a judge’s predispositions, such as being more or less favorable toward alimony. The truth is that most judges focus on the facts and strive to make fair decisions. What matters more than a judge’s tendencies is having an attorney who has built relationships with the bench, earning credibility that benefits their clients. This rapport helps ensure that your case is presented in a way that resonates with the court. We build a reputation and then we lend it to you, our client.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022unknown\\u0022\\u003ePreparing for The Unknown\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhile you can prepare to try a case with the assigned judge, things can change, so it is important to prepare for all scenarios. Judges may be substituted due to scheduling conflicts or emergencies, making it difficult to know exactly who will preside over a case until you are there. There are also situations where it can be challenging to predict how a judge will rule on key issues. Ultimately, effective advocacy—rooted in understanding the law, presenting facts clearly, and proposing reasonable solutions—is far more critical than relying on a judge's specific tendencies. The focus should always remain on crafting a strong case and resolving issues efficiently, regardless of who is on the bench.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is deeply personal. With the right strategy, you can create the best possible outcome. Understanding the role of the judge can provide clarity and confidence as you navigate the process. Most cases are resolved without a trial, but negotiations can be driven by an understanding of what might happen in court. While the judge’s decisions determine the outcome of a trial, your success ultimately depends on preparation, negotiation, and presentation of practical solutions. Whether negotiating a settlement or preparing for trial, the goal is to create a clear, fair plan.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Negotiating While Preparing for Court\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#negotiating\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Assessing Fairness\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#assessingFairness\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"The Judge’s Priorities\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#priorities\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Presenting Solutions, Not Problems\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#presentingSolutions\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"The Value of Legal Expertise\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#legalExpertise\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_5_title\":\"Preparing for The Unknown\",\"_contents_list_5_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_5_link_id\":\"#unknown\",\"_contents_list_5_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":6,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Randy Kessler\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Cost can vary widely based on the complexity of the case and the willingness of both parties to work together. When people are more amicable, work together, and trust each other, you can streamline the process and save money. In contentious cases where custody is being disputed or where one spouse is not transparent about their financial situation, the process can be time-consuming and expensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile every situation is unique, certain factors tend to drive up the cost of divorce. Understanding these elements can help you prepare for the financial realities and make more informed decisions. Factors that may affect cost include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Willingness\\u0022\\u003eWillingness to Collaborate\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#CaseComplexity\\u0022\\u003eCase Complexity\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#financialTransparency\\u0022\\u003eFinancial Transparency\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#childCustody\\u0022\\u003eChild Custody\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#Litigation\\u0022\\u003eLitigation\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-920995\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Factors-Impacting-1024x643.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Factors Impacting\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022643\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Willingness\\u0022\\u003eWillingness to Collaborate\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhile many clients come in hoping for an amicable or uncontested divorce, true uncontested cases—where both parties agree on all terms upfront—are rare. Most cases involve some level of due diligence and negotiation, particularly in high-asset divorces or when custody is at stake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my experience, about 80% of cases settle before reaching trial, but the process can still take time and may require mediation. The remaining 20% tend to proceed to trial, often due to one party’s refusal to compromise. To minimize costs and stress, I always encourage clients to approach the process amicably when possible, balancing emotional desires with a practical cost-benefit analysis. If we need to litigate aggressively, we will. It is usually in your best interest to work together, at least in the beginning.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022CaseComplexity\\u0022\\u003eCase Complexity\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFrom the initial consultation, I can often get a sense of how complex a case will be. Certain red flags indicate that the divorce may be more contentious:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFinancial Disputes\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If you or your spouse believe that the other is hiding assets or lying about finances, the case will likely require additional discovery or forensic experts.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCustody Disagreements\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If you and your spouse both want primary custody and cannot agree on a parenting plan, the case becomes significantly more complex.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nIn some cases, you don't really know until you find out what the other side is thinking. It takes two people to be reasonable and reach an agreement. If the other side refuses to cooperate, a case that seems straightforward can quickly escalate into a lengthy battle.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eApproaching divorce with a mindset of collaboration and compromise, when possible, can save significant costs and stress.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022financialTransparency\\u0022\\u003eFinancial Transparency\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen people are not forthcoming about their financial situation, it complicates the case. This often leads to a costly discovery process that involves gathering detailed financial information, and may also involve expert guidance from forensic accountants. When a spouse hides assets or refuses to cooperate, the process becomes drawn out and more expensive.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022childCustody\\u0022\\u003eChild Custody\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn my experience, custody battles are some of the most contentious and expensive situations. When you're talking about money, it's more straightforward. When you're talking about your kids, you can't put a price tag on that. Custody disputes involve deep emotional stakes, and parents who cannot agree on custody arrangements may find themselves in prolonged legal battles. Depending on the situation, we may need to engage a guardian ad litem or custody evaluator. All of these things can significantly drive up the cost of divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022Litigation\\u0022\\u003eLitigation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCases that go to trial are far more expensive than those resolved through negotiation or mediation. These often involve extreme disagreements over custody, alimony, or asset division. Litigating these issues requires additional legal preparation, court appearances, and often the involvement of experts like custody evaluators or forensic accountants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s essential to weigh the cost of pursuing a particular outcome against the potential financial and emotional benefits. For example, if going to trial to secure a small increase in asset division will cost more than the increase itself, it may not be worth the fight. As spouses start considering the cost-benefit of their decisions, they often become more open to negotiation. If money is no object, you may decide to take a different approach.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is a deeply personal process and the costs, both financial and emotional, can vary greatly depending on the circumstances. Understanding the factors that drive up the cost of divorce, such as case complexity, financial transparency, child custody disputes, and litigation, can help you make more informed decisions. While it’s tempting to focus solely on “winning,” balancing your goals with the practical realities of time, expense, and emotional impact is often the key to a smoother resolution.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Willingness to Collaborate\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#Willingness\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Case Complexity\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#CaseComplexity\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Financial Transparency\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#financialTransparency\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Child Custody\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#childCustody\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Litigation\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#Litigation\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":5,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany Family Law Attorneys\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

It can also include inheritances or gifts that are given to one party during the marriage. These assets are typically set aside in divorce when you are considering how to divide things up.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremarital property can get complicated in divorce cases where there is a co-mingling of premarital assets with marital assets, potentially altering their classification and making the division process more complex. If you’re considering divorce or want a clearer understanding of your marital estate, knowing how assets are categorized and divided is essential.

Many clients are surprised to learn how easily premarital assets can be transformed into marital property through commingling. For example, if you add your spouse’s name to a bank account that you had prior to marriage or use marital funds to renovate a home that belonged to your spouse before you were together, the asset may be reclassified as marital property, either fully or partially. This is an area where the details—and documentation—matter.\\r\\nSome things you can do to avoid commingling include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eKeep accounts solely in your name.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAvoid using marital funds for improvements or contributions.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMaintain detailed financial records.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\nMost married couples end up with commingled assets. In those cases, a forensic accountant may still be able to determine if there is a premarital component.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022prenuptialPostnuptial\\u0022\\u003eRole of Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPrenuptial agreements are common tools to protect premarital assets. Many clients who experienced contentious first divorces learn from the experience and opt for prenups to avoid litigation in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring your marriage, postnuptial agreements can serve a similar purpose, outlining how assets will be handled if the marriage ends. These agreements can address concerns about commingling, passive appreciation, and asset division, providing peace of mind for both parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my experience, people in second or third marriages are often more meticulous about maintaining separate property. They’ve learned from past divorces that failing to keep clear records can complicate asset division. A common reason for creating a prenup or postnup in these marriages is to avoid repeating previous mistakes and ensure a cleaner resolution if the relationship doesn’t work out.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eWhether you’re dealing with bank accounts, retirement funds, real estate, business interests, or inheritances, it’s critical to demonstrate that you’ve kept everything separate to protect those assets in divorce.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022bankAccounts\\u0022\\u003eBank Accounts\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nBank accounts commonly become commingled once you are married. If you add your spouse’s name to a bank account that was opened prior to marriage, it becomes marital property. It would seem pretty easy to assume that if your spouse had $100,000 in the bank before the marriage, it would be premarital. Under the law, though, if your name has been added to the account, it is now likely a marital asset.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022retirementAccounts\\u0022\\u003eRetirement Accounts\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCommingling can also complicate a retirement asset. A retirement account opened before the marriage is a premarital asset. If you continue to contribute to that account during the marriage, those contributions would be marital contributions. This is further complicated by any gains on the account value. An expert may be needed to untangle the marital and premarital components and to determine exactly how much is attributable to each.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022realEstate\\u0022\\u003eReal Estate\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you or your spouse own real estate that was purchased prior to marriage, it is likely considered premarital property at first. People are often surprised to learn during the divorce process that simply adding your spouse's name to the deed on a house converts it into a marital asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppreciation of real estate that is considered a premarital property can also have a marital component. Appreciation due to the real estate market may still be considered premarital, but appreciation due to renovations may not, especially if those renovations are funded by marital income, Both can exist within the same asset, so a lawyer and accountant may be needed to help split the two components.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022businessInterests\\u0022\\u003eBusiness Interests\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nClosely held businesses can also be complicated. If your business was started during the marriage, it is likely considered marital property. Regardless of whose name is listed in the operating agreement, there will likely be at least some marital component. This happens because marital funds are often invested through the course of operating a family-owned business, or time is spent by one or both spouses to run it. If that’s the case, you may need a forensic accountant to separate out the premarital and marital value.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022inheritances\\u0022\\u003eGifts or Inheritances\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf a gift or inheritance is given to one spouse, it is typically considered separate property, similar to a premarital asset. If it is given to both, like a check written to you and your spouse, it is considered a marital asset. An exception to this can happen when you cash the check. Depositing these funds into a joint account may transform it into a marital asset.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022childrenAccounts\\u0022\\u003eChildren’s Accounts\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen there are children's accounts in a divorce, we typically keep those separate from the marital estate. Like a lot of people, you may have 529 or investment accounts for your child. In that situation, the portion that's attributed to the child should be put in an account that's for the benefit of the child and not touched. If it does get co-mingled at any point into a joint account, then it could be considered a marital asset subject to division.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUnderstanding the distinction between premarital (or separate) and marital property is essential when navigating a divorce. The process can be complex, especially when assets become commingled or their value changes during the marriage. Whether you’re dealing with bank accounts, retirement funds, real estate, business interests, or inheritances, it’s critical to demonstrate that you’ve kept everything separate to protect those assets in divorce. Otherwise, they may be considered part of the marital estate and be subject to division. Tools like prenuptial and postnuptial agreements can also offer valuable protection and clarity.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Protecting Premarital Assets\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#protectingPremarital\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Role of Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#prenuptialPostnuptial\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Bank Accounts\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#bankAccounts\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Retirement Accounts\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#retirementAccounts\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Real Estate\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#realEstate\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_5_title\":\"Business Interests\",\"_contents_list_5_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_5_link_id\":\"#businessInterests\",\"_contents_list_5_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_6_title\":\"Gifts or Inheritances\",\"_contents_list_6_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_6_link_id\":\"#inheritances\",\"_contents_list_6_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_7_title\":\"Children’s Accounts\",\"_contents_list_7_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_7_link_id\":\"#childrenAccounts\",\"_contents_list_7_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":8,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Kessler \\u0026 Solomiany Family Law Attorneys\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/kessler-solomiany-llc/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

One of the most significant issues that can complicate a divorce is the improper use of marital funds or assets before or during the divorce process. The legal terms for this is “marital waste” or “dissipation of assets.” This can include extravagant spending, risky investments, or using funds for extramarital affairs, and often happens without the knowledge or consent of the other spouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourts take marital waste seriously because it can undermine the equitable division of assets.

Avoid making large purchases, taking expensive trips, or engaging in activities that could be viewed as financially irresponsible, especially if these only benefit you or people outside of your family. If infidelity is an issue, marital funds spent towards supporting extramarital affairs could be considered marital waste.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFocus on Practical and Necessary Expenses\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nWhen spending money during a divorce, prioritize practical and essential expenses. Courts will differentiate between necessary spending and actions that could harm the financial stability of the marital estate.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCommunicate with Your Attorney Before Major Decisions\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nIf you’re considering any large financial moves, consult your attorney first. They will be able to provide counsel on the implications of those decisions. Timing matters, and you may want to wait until after your divorce is finalized.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMaintain Transparency\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nAttempting to hide or justify marital waste can backfire.

Ultimately, the person who commits marital waste may need to replenish the marital estate, which is often resolved during the asset division process.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, let’s say your total assets are valued at $1 million, and they are being split 50/50. In this case, each spouse would get $500,000. However, if it came to light that your spouse spent $200,000 on an affair, it could be determined that your total assets should have been worth $1.2 million without that extra spend. You might be entitled to $600,000 (and your spouse the remaining $400,000), which would be half of your marital estate prior to the marital waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetermining marital waste can also be expensive. A lack of transparency can increase the cost of discovery by requiring forensic accountants or other experts to help unravel unusual transactions. You might find it harder to come to a settlement agreement, making it necessary to litigate and drive up the cost of your divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022personalSpending\\u0022\\u003ePersonal Spending Can Cost You in the Divorce\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the most unusual divorce cases I’ve handled involved a spouse who, during the divorce proceedings, spent $150,000 of marital funds on gender-affirming procedures in another country. While this decision was deeply personal, the timing created significant financial and legal challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a drawn-out and costly court battle, spending on the procedure was classified as marital waste, and the $150,000 was deducted from the spouse’s share of the marital assets. This example underscores the importance of considering the financial and legal consequences of personal decisions made during a divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMarital waste can complicate an already challenging divorce process, but with careful planning and professional guidance, it’s possible to avoid these pitfalls. Once your divorce is final, you can choose how to spend your money, but extravagant transactions ahead of and during your divorce can have serious consequences. Always think strategically about your financial decisions during this time, and consult your attorney, who can help you avoid potential complications.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"How to Avoid Marital Waste\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#maritalWaste\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Consequences of Marital Waste\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#consequences\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Personal Spending Can Cost You in the Divorce\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#personalSpending\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":3,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

For many, deciding whether to be the one to file can feel overwhelming.

This can be particularly impactful if your case involves serious allegations of misconduct. You’ll also have the last word during court proceedings, allowing you to re-emphasize your position.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePreparedness\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nFiling first allows you to be proactive rather than reactive.

While you may not need to go to court, it can strengthen your position if you do. Since we would have the first and last word, I use that strategically. The first word will be about emphasizing the bad behavior, while the last word will be used to re-emphasize the behavior and justify what we’re asking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the case settles before trial, taking the initial step demonstrates that you are serious about ending the marriage and pursuing a fair resolution.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022disadvantagesFiling\\u0022\\u003eDisadvantages of Filing First\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFrom a legal point of view, there are really no disadvantages to being the one who files for divorce. The primary consideration is whether you’re emotionally and logistically ready to move forward. If you’re not prepared, you can always dismiss the case and refile if you decide to proceed later. It's not a bad thing for somebody to be indecisive about wanting a divorce. Judges understand that this is a significant and emotional decision and will not hold it against you in court, should your case end up in litigation.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFiling first can provide strategic advantages, particularly if the case involves misconduct or is likely to go to court.

Finding support is critical because the emotional toll of divorce can exacerbate issues and test your sobriety.

Addiction is rarely the sole cause of a divorce, but it often exacerbates existing issues. It can add a little gas to the fire with the problems that are already there. The strain of substance use on relationships, combined with threats to shared custody or demands for supervised visitation, can be overwhelming and prompt both individuals and couples to seek therapy. For some, the threat of losing access to their children serves as a wake-up call to address their addiction and mental health.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThe willingness of the addicted parent to engage in recovery is the primary indicator of a positive outcome.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022addiction\\u0022\\u003eAddiction is a Lifelong Challenge\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the most important things to understand about addiction is that it is a lifelong battle. Recovery isn’t a destination but a journey. While therapy can be incredibly helpful at certain points—particularly in the early stages or during life transitions like divorce—ongoing support is critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelve-step programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA), offer invaluable support networks. These programs provide a foundation for lifelong recovery, teaching coping skills and fostering a sense of community. Therapy often complements these programs, helping individuals address underlying issues and navigate the complexities of life in recovery.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022recovery\\u0022\\u003eAdvice for Those in Recovery\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe stress of the divorce process can be a significant trigger for relapse. If you’re in recovery and navigating a divorce, now is the time to double down on the strategies that have helped you maintain sobriety. Increase your attendance at 12-step meetings, stay in close contact with your sponsor, and lean on your recovery community. Therapy can also provide additional support, helping you process the emotions of divorce and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-care is also essential during this time. Focus on the basics like food, rest, and keeping your space tidy. These things help us feel better day in and day out, make better choices, and handle stressful situations better. Physical activity is a great stress reliever and one of the best things you can do for your mental health. Consider incorporating mindfulness practices, like meditation or breathwork, to help manage intense emotions.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022childCustody\\u0022\\u003eImpact on Child Custody\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAddiction doesn’t just affect the individual, it impacts the entire family. Often, there are concerns over custody arrangements. Parents can be very intent on exercising their rights. An addicted spouse may realize that their substance use is jeopardizing their ability to maintain custody or even see their children, which can be a motivator to seek help. In other cases, a spouse seeks support because they’re struggling with whether to stay in the marriage or move forward with divorce due to their partner’s addiction. They may wonder if their spouse’s environment is safe for the children and might fight for sole custody or supervised visitation. In some situations, a child advocate or expert may be appointed to assess the home and make recommendations for custody arrangements.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022optimizingOutcomes\\u0022\\u003eOptimizing Outcomes\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe willingness of the addicted parent to engage in recovery is the primary indicator of a positive outcome. A parent who is open to treatment, drug screening, 12-step programs, and ongoing support has a much better chance of maintaining custody and rebuilding trust within the family. These measures not only ensure a safe environment for the children but also support the addicted parent’s recovery. When parents are committed to making necessary changes, shared custody can often be maintained, and the family can move forward in a healthier way.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, if a parent refuses to acknowledge the severity of their addiction or take steps to address it, the situation may become more contentious. In these cases, the other parent may need to fight for sole custody to ensure the children’s safety. If you’re in this position, it’s important to work with legal and therapeutic professionals to develop a plan that protects your children while offering opportunities for the addicted parent to seek help.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is never easy, and addiction adds another layer of difficulty. With the right support, it is possible to navigate these challenges and emerge stronger on the other side.

Lying to Your Attorney\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe only way I can defend you and present a case that will yield the best outcome is to know what I am up against. I’ve heard it all, and our conversations are generally protected by attorney-client privilege. It’s best to be upfront about what’s been going on in your marriage that has led you to divorce. Similarly, failing to disclose all assets and financial details is a serious mistake that can lead to legal penalties. Be honest and transparent to ensure a fair settlement.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022floodingAttorney\\u0022\\u003e2. Flooding Your Attorney with Emails\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen going through a divorce, you’ll likely have many questions. Sending your attorney individual emails for every question can bog down communication and increase costs. Instead, consolidate your questions into a single email or list and send them once a week unless it’s an emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddressing multiple questions at once allows your attorney to respond more efficiently and helps keep your legal fees in check. This approach also ensures that you both remain organized and focused on the most important aspects of your case.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022professionalAdvice\\u0022\\u003e3. Ignoring Professional Advice\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nYour attorney, financial advisor, therapist, and other professionals are there to guide and support you. Ignoring their advice can lead to poor decisions that harm your case or prolong the process. For example, failing to follow financial advice might result in unfavorable asset division, while disregarding legal counsel could weaken your position in court.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve the best outcome, trust the expertise of your team and follow their recommendations. Their guidance is rooted in experience and designed to protect your interests.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eDivorce is undoubtedly one of the most challenging times in a person’s life, but the way you navigate the process can make a significant difference in the outcome.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022socialMedia\\u0022\\u003e4. Oversharing on Social Media\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSocial media can be a minefield during a divorce. Avoid posting anything, or at least anything related to your case, as it can be used against you in court. Even seemingly innocent posts about your personal life can create complications and undermine your claims. As I often tell my clients: “There’s no productive reason to post anything about your divorce on social media.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you feel you need to post, stick to neutral content, like pictures of pets or meals. However, it’s best to limit your activity entirely to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022digitalTrail\\u0022\\u003e5. Leaving a Digital Trail of Poor Judgment\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAnything you write—emails, texts, or social media posts—can create a digital record. Attorneys frequently use these records as evidence, so it’s critical to be mindful of your digital footprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, I’ve seen cases where an individual wasn’t paying child support but posted about lavish vacations and expensive purchases. This digital evidence demonstrated a lack of financial responsibility and led to severe repercussions, including jail time.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022emotionalDecisions\\u0022\\u003e6. Making Emotional Decisions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThroughout the divorce process, you will likely face triggering moments, but letting your emotions drive your decisions can be costly. Part of my role is guiding you through these tough times in a way that helps you avoid reacting impulsively to your spouse’s actions or refusing to compromise, knowing that emotional decisions often result in unnecessary conflict and higher legal fees.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake time to process your feelings and work with a therapist to manage the emotional toll. Staying level-headed will help you focus on achieving a fair and practical resolution.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022\\u0022\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce is undoubtedly one of the toughest times in a person’s life. The way you navigate the process can make a significant difference in the outcome. By avoiding these common mistakes—such as dishonesty, impulsive decisions, or misusing social media—you can protect your interests and set yourself up for a smoother transition. Rely on your team of trusted professionals, follow their guidance, and focus on making informed, level-headed decisions.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Lying to Your Attorney\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#lyingAttorney\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Flooding Your Attorney with Emails\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#floodingAttorney\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Ignoring Professional Advice\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#professionalAdvice\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Oversharing on Social Media\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#socialMedia\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Leaving a Digital Trail of Poor Judgment\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#digitalTrail\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_5_title\":\"Making Emotional Decisions\",\"_contents_list_5_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_5_link_id\":\"#emotionalDecisions\",\"_contents_list_5_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":6,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

When one spouse owns a business, its valuation can become a contentious issue. Broad disparities between competing expert valuations can make settlement negotiations nearly impossible. If you can’t bridge the gap, litigation may be necessary to resolve the dispute.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my cases helped shape the Georgia legal framework for valuing a business in divorce. My client’s expert valued the spouse’s medical practice at $500,000, but the spouse’s expert claimed that it was just a job, and should have no value. After a lengthy trial and appeals, my client prevailed and was awarded “business alimony” as a way to divide that business asset. When faced with significant discrepancies like this situation, Judges tend to be reasonable and look for equitable solutions. To support this process, it is critical to work with credible experts who provide realistic valuations based on accepted methods.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eHigh net-worth divorces are inherently complex and require careful handling of financial, legal, and emotional issues.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022navigatingTax\\u0022\\u003eNavigating Tax Implications\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nTax issues are another major concern in high net-worth divorces. The division of assets often comes with significant tax implications, such as capital gains on investments or penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, while a retirement account may appear to be worth $500,000, its actual after-tax value could be substantially less. Failing to account for these tax implications can lead to an inequitable settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo manage this challenge, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) should be part of the divorce team. A CPA can estimate the after-tax value of assets, ensure compliance with tax laws, and help you make informed decisions about property division.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022resettingExpectations\\u0022\\u003eResetting Expectations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nSometimes, the challenge is more than financial–it’s personal. In high net-worth cases, that wealth is often driven by someone who is very successful in their line of work. Sometimes the individual who has generated such wealth has a mindset that their spouse doesn’t deserve an equitable share. Wealth created during the marriage tends to be a marital asset that needs to be divided, so one or both spouses may need to reset expectations and take a practical approach to reaching an equitable settlement.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022dividingHighValue\\u0022\\u003eDividing High-Value or Unusual Assets\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nHigh net-worth divorces often involve unique assets such as expensive wine collections, fine art, or jewelry. These items must be professionally appraised to determine their value, and disputes can arise over how to divide or sell them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one case I handled, the husband owned a collection of 30 classic cars. The couple hired a broker to appraise and sell the cars, with the proceeds divided equally. This process took nearly a year after the divorce was finalized, demonstrating how time-consuming it can be to manage such assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor unusual assets that cannot be sold or divided, such as hair plugs (a real case example), it is essential to focus on practical solutions.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nHigh net-worth divorces are inherently complex and require careful handling of financial, legal, and emotional issues. Whether it’s valuing a business, navigating tax consequences, or dividing unique assets, having a skilled legal team and trusted financial experts is essential. By approaching these challenges through a practical lens, you can work toward a fair resolution that protects your financial future or be well-prepared to defend your position in court.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Valuing Business Interests\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#valuingBusiness\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Navigating Tax Implications\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#navigatingTax\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Resetting Expectations\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#resettingExpectations\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Dividing High-Value or Unusual Assets\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#dividingHighValue\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Signed before marriage, prenups help protect premarital property and provide peace of mind should the marriage not work out. So that you can be prepared for how prenups will be viewed in divorce, let’s look at some important concepts:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#risePrenups\\u0022\\u003eThe Rise of Prenups\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#WhatPrenups\\u0022\\u003eWhat Prenups Cover\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#prenupsHold\\u0022\\u003eDo Prenups Hold Up in Court?\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#marriageEnds\\u0022\\u003eWhat to Expect if Your Marriage Ends\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-921019\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Understanding-Prenups\\u002d\\u002d1024x574.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Understanding Prenups\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022574\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022risePrenups\\u0022\\u003eThe Rise of Prenups\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPrenups have become increasingly common, especially in recent years. I think the effect of COVID on unhealthy marriages contributed to the rise in prenups. The pandemic acted as a stress test for many marriages, ripping the bandaid right off and exposing marital issues. Prior to that, spouses would work in different locations every day. All of a sudden, you're in the same room all day, every day, and you realize that you can't stand this person. Those who divorced and subsequently remarried were more likely to consider prenups, especially when significant assets, business interests, or family wealth were involved, or a previous divorce involved litigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany couples who kept their strained relationships together through COVID questioned the strength of their marriage and started to reassess their financial futures. Seeking similar peace of mind, some started talking about safeguards for their relationships. Some signed postnuptial agreements (postnups), similar to prenups but signed during marriage.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eHaving a prenup in place can provide clarity, reduce the emotional and financial strain of divorce, and help you avoid unnecessary litigation.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022WhatPrenups\\u0022\\u003eWhat Prenups Cover\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nPrenups often address potential future issues like premarital assets, business interests, family inheritances, property division, alimony, and other financial decisions. They can be particularly important when one or both spouses are bringing significant assets into the marriage, especially family assets or business interests. Prenups do have limitations. Child custody and child support are not covered in a prenup. Those decisions are reserved for the time of divorce when you can better assess the state of circumstances related to the children and their needs at that time. Everything else can be included.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022prenupsHold\\u0022\\u003eDo Prenups Hold Up in Court?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nYes, prenuptial agreements generally hold up in court if they are executed properly. I think judges are often inclined to do everything they can to uphold prenups because they simplify the divorce process and resolve many contentious issues in advance. To ensure enforceability, a prenup must address three critical factors:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eFull and Complete Financial Disclosure: Both parties must fully disclose their assets, liabilities, and income.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eNo Significant Changes in Circumstances: If circumstances haven’t drastically changed, such as an unforeseen and debilitating illness, the prenup is more likely to hold up.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe Agreement is Not Unconscionable: The prenup must not be so grossly unfair, one-sided, or oppressive that no other reasonable person would sign it.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\nAs long as these criteria are met, the likelihood of a court enforcing a prenup is high.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022marriageEnds\\u0022\\u003eWhat to Expect if Your Marriage Ends\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf your marriage ultimately ends in divorce, having a prenup in place provides a clear framework for resolving issues that you’ve already agreed on. When properly drafted and executed, a prenup can streamline the divorce process by reducing disputes and uncertainty. You and your spouse can focus on resolving those issues that were not covered, like child custody. By setting expectations early, a prenup can minimize conflict, lower legal costs, and expedite the resolution of the divorce, allowing both parties to focus on moving forward.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA well-crafted prenuptial agreement can be a valuable tool for setting clear financial expectations and protecting assets in divorce. Although prenups can’t predetermine child custody or child support, they can address key financial matters upfront. Having a prenup in place can provide clarity, reduce the emotional and financial strain of divorce, and help you avoid unnecessary litigation.

Mediation works best for individuals who understand their financial situation, are open to compromise, and are ready to settle their case.

This means that they have access to the information that they need about key issues and fully understand their finances. Being well-informed allows both parties to approach the process realistically and focus on reaching a fair settlement. Mediation is ideal for those who want to avoid the emotional and financial toll of prolonged litigation and are ready to end and settle the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it can lead to a successful outcome, mediation is not for everyone. It is not conducive to people who are entrenched in conflict, are unwilling to compromise, or have unrealistic expectations. A skilled mediator can sometimes bridge the gap, providing a reality check by explaining what is and isn’t likely to happen in court. A good mediator will also tell you when your position is unreasonable and guide you toward a more practical resolution.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eMediation is a powerful tool that can minimize conflict, save time, reduce costs, and ease the emotional strain of divorce.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022mediationProcess\\u0022\\u003eThe Mediation Process\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nTypically, mediation takes two or more full days. It is spaced out over time, allowing parties to reflect between sessions. This measured approach ensures decisions are made thoughtfully rather than under the pressure of marathon sessions. When people are tired, they’re more likely to make decisions they’ll regret the next day. Instead, by pausing after a productive session, couples can approach the next session with clearer minds and a better sense of direction.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022firstDay\\u0022\\u003eFirst Day Sets the Tone\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nBy the end of the first day, we will start to understand how the process should move forward. Either we’ll have made progress to schedule another session or we will need to look for other options. If we don't make progress, it does not mean that we are never going to settle. We may end up in court, but we can also keep working through mediation to bring the differences closer together.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022mediationFails\\u0022\\u003eWhat to Expect If Mediation Fails\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMediation, even if not immediately successful, often lays the groundwork for resolution and can be an essential step in the divorce process. Every case does not settle in mediation, and that’s okay. Just because you don’t reach an agreement, it doesn’t mean that you are destined for court. Many cases settle closer to trial, often on the eve of the trial itself. When mediation doesn’t yield results, it’s time to shift to a dual-track strategy: preparing for trial while remaining open to settlement opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach involves taking depositions, gathering evidence, and strengthening your case. With a stronger position, you can present a settlement offer that is more likely to be accepted. It often works best when both sides feel they have something to gain and something to lose. Building leverage through the process can encourage the other party to agree to a settlement before going to court.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMediation is a powerful tool that can minimize conflict, save time, reduce costs, and ease the emotional strain of divorce. While it doesn’t work for everyone, it is highly effective for those willing to approach the process with preparation, transparency, and a willingness to compromise. Even if mediation doesn’t resolve everything, it often lays the groundwork for a settlement later in the process. Whether your case settles in mediation or requires a trial, having an experienced attorney by your side ensures you’re prepared for whatever path your divorce takes.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Who Benefits from Mediation?\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#benefitsMediation\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"The Mediation Process\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#mediationProcess\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"First Day Sets the Tone\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#firstDay\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"What to Expect If Mediation Fails\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#mediationFails\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

While some courts may have become desensitized to adultery due to its frequency, it remains a relevant factor in determining two critical aspects of divorce:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eEquitable Division of Marital Assets\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nIf marital funds were spent in having an affair—such as hotel stays, gifts, or trips—this reduction of assets can affect how property is divided. For instance, if $20,000 was spent on the affair, that amount might be credited back to the other spouse during property division.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAlimony Determinations\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nInfidelity can also influence alimony awards. If the unfaithful spouse’s actions contributed to the breakdown of the marriage, it may impact how much, if any, spousal support they are required to pay or receive.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022badBehavior\\u0022\\u003eProve the Bad Behavior\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhen infidelity is suspected, proving it and identifying related financial misconduct are crucial steps. This involves a process where financial records such as credit card statements and bank transactions are examined. In some cases, a forensic accountant may be hired to uncover hidden assets or track expenditures linked to the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile investigating infidelity-related spending is common, it’s essential to weigh the cost of this process against its potential financial benefit. For example, if uncovering misuse of marital funds could significantly impact the division of assets, it may be worth pursuing. Otherwise, the expense of discovery might outweigh the potential gains.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eInfidelity complicates divorce, but it doesn’t have to derail your ability to achieve a fair outcome.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022openMind\\u0022\\u003eApproach Mediation with an Open Mind\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMediation can still be an effective tool for resolving your divorce, even if it involves infidelity. A skilled mediator can use the evidence of bad conduct to help both sides come to an understanding of a fair settlement, given the circumstances. If your situation is emotionally charged, knowing that bad behavior or financial misconduct will come to light in court can also motivate the offending spouse to agree to more equitable terms.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022emotionalToll\\u0022\\u003eSeek Support for the Emotional Toll\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nBeyond the legal and financial implications, infidelity can make the divorce process more emotional and drawn out. The betrayed spouse often needs time to process and heal from the hurt, which can slow down negotiations or the ability to reach a settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend seeking support from a therapist who can help provide the tools needed to process emotions, build resilience, and focus on the practical aspects of the divorce.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022honestLawyer\\u0022\\u003eBe Honest with Your Lawyer\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf infidelity is a factor in your divorce, honesty with your attorney is essential. Your lawyer needs the full truth to build a strong case, address potential challenges, and advocate effectively on your behalf. I cannot defend against the unknown. Lying or withholding information can backfire, leaving your attorney unprepared to handle unexpected developments.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome things that people are tempted to try to conceal in situations involving infidelity are the number of affairs and the related financial implications. Often, they think that their spouse won’t find out. You may not want to admit bad behavior, but It is critical to fully disclose your circumstances to your attorney so that they can help you find the best possible outcome.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022knowJudge\\u0022\\u003eKnow When to Use a Judge\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn Georgia and Texas, it is possible to file for a jury trial to handle your divorce. While you may want a group of peers to hear your story and punish your spouse with increased alimony or a more favorable division of assets, there are several reasons that a judge might be a better option. Jury trials can be lengthy and expensive, often lasting a week or more. They also introduce uncertainty, as jurors may view marital issues differently than judges. For these reasons, jury trials should generally be reserved for extreme cases where the financial stakes are high, and the evidence of misconduct is substantial.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nInfidelity complicates divorce, but it doesn’t have to derail your ability to achieve a fair outcome. By understanding how marital misconduct influences property division, alimony, and the overall process, you can make informed decisions. If you suspect infidelity or are preparing to navigate its effects on your divorce, consult an experienced attorney who can guide you through the legal and emotional complexities of your situation.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Understand the Legal and Financial Implications\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#financialImplications\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Prove the Bad Behavior\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#badBehavior\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Approach Mediation with an Open Mind\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#openMind\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Seek Support for the Emotional Toll\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#emotionalToll\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Be Honest with Your Lawyer\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#honestLawyer\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_5_title\":\"Know When to Use a Judge\",\"_contents_list_5_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_5_link_id\":\"#knowJudge\",\"_contents_list_5_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":6,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Gary Graham\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/gary-graham/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Partner at Stern Edlin Graham Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/stern-edlin-graham-family-law-p-c/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

My practice is geared toward addressing the complexities of dividing substantial estates. These divorces are about more than property; they’re about securing futures and protecting what matters most. Some common themes that come up in these situations include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#biggestFears\\u0022\\u003eBiggest Fears Differ for Men and Women\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#realityChecks\\u0022\\u003eReality Checks Are Important\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#financialComplexities\\u0022\\u003eFinancial Complexities Require Clear Guidance\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-921025\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Common-Divorce-Themes\\u002d\\u002d1024x682.jpeg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Common Divorce Themes\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022682\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022biggestFears\\u0022\\u003eBiggest Fears Differ for Men and Women\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe concerns my clients bring to my office often differ based on gender. While there are exceptions, there are recurring themes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eFor Women:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nThe primary fear for many women is losing time with their children. They’ve often been the primary caregivers, the ones saying goodnight, attending school events, and being there for every milestone. The idea of shared custody can feel like an earth-shattering disruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial concerns also weigh heavily, but these are often alleviated once we gather a clear picture of the marital assets. Knowing they will have enough monthly cash flow to maintain their lifestyle brings significant relief. Partnering with a financial advisor, we analyze the numbers and create a plan to ensure financial stability.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eAcceptance allows you to focus on what you can control, such as creating the best possible co-parenting arrangement and maintaining your relationship with your children.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eFor Men:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nMen, on the other hand, often express their greatest fears about financial losses. Dividing assets, potentially giving up half of what they’ve built, and starting over can feel overwhelming. While this is a significant concern, I remind them that time is on their side—even in their 40s or 50s, there’s plenty of opportunity to rebuild wealth and improve financial standing.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022realityChecks\\u0022\\u003eReality Checks Are Important\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the most important aspects of my role is helping my clients set realistic expectations. I’m upfront with clients about what they can and cannot control. For example, when it comes to custody, courts will typically award reasonable parenting time to both parents unless there are extreme circumstances like addiction or abuse. For parents struggling with the thought of not seeing their children every night, it may be something that you have to face and work through. Child custody is not all or nothing. Even if you are not the primary caregiver, you are still entitled to time with your children in most circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this can be hard to hear, it’s a crucial step in moving forward. Acceptance allows you to focus on what you can control, such as creating the best possible co-parenting arrangement and maintaining your relationship with your children. If the divorce is one you initiated, this conversation is often easier. If it’s not, it requires more care and reassurance, but the message remains the same—this is part of the process.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022financialComplexities\\u0022\\u003eFinancial Complexities Require Clear Guidance\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFinancial concerns are another area where clear guidance is essential. For divorces involving straightforward assets like retirement accounts, your primary residence, and savings, reaching an agreement is usually manageable. Situations involving more complex assets, such as stock options, real estate investments, or business ownership, require detailed attention and expertise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dividing assets, fears about the future often create an additional layer of complexity. Seeing it as an opportunity to rebuild or ensure a steady and reliable monthly income is important.

As an experienced divorce attorney, I’ve seen clients make decisions in the heat of the moment that can significantly impact their case. Mistakes made during this time can complicate negotiations, fuel animosity, and even increase legal costs.

Your lawyer is your advocate and is bound by attorney-client privilege, meaning our conversations are private, but I can't make informed, strategic decisions if I don't know the whole story. Whether it’s financial details, personal conduct, or other significant events, withholding information can backfire. I've unknowingly stepped into a lot of bad situations that perhaps I could have navigated around for the client had I known the full story. To provide effective representation, your lawyer needs all the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes a client will fail to disclose something like an affair because they are embarrassed, or omit assets because they don’t want their spouse to get half. Opposing counsel is likely to uncover it during the discovery process. Once that happens, it casts doubt on your credibility and may compel the other side to scrutinize details of your case more aggressively. This can lead to prolonged litigation, increased costs, and a loss of trust that’s difficult to rebuild.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo avoid this, be completely open and forthright with your attorney from the start. Even if you’re embarrassed or worried about how certain information might affect your case, your lawyer needs to know the full picture.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eDivorce is the time to focus on presenting the best version of yourself.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022wrongPeople\\u0022\\u003eListening to the Wrong People\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce often attracts unsolicited advice from friends, family, and even casual acquaintances. While well-meaning, these individuals are not legal professionals and may incorrectly compare your case to others. It is important not to try to measure your case by another, as cases may seem similar, but the circumstances could be vastly different.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery divorce is unique, and advice from someone else’s experience may not apply to your situation. Worse, listening to uninformed or emotionally charged advice can lead you to make decisions that are not in your best interest. Instead, trust your attorney’s expertise. They understand the legal nuances of your case and are equipped to guide you based on those facts and circumstances.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022dynamicsPersist\\u0022\\u003eAllowing Power Dynamics to Persist\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAnother big mistake happens when a spouse tries to carry unhealthy dynamics, like financial control or emotional manipulation, into the divorce process. I may see this when I represent the non-moneyed spouse, typically someone who has been a homemaker, where there is a significant imbalance of power in the marriage. Over time, this dynamic may have left the individual feeling suppressed or controlled. Even as they learn that their spouse’s interests are directly opposed to their own, they may still defer to their soon-to-be ex-spouse’s opinions on how the case will unfold or what actions they should take. For instance, I’ve had clients argue against their own best interests because their spouse insisted they wouldn’t be entitled to alimony or certain assets. Breaking free from these patterns is critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs your attorney, I’m here to advocate for you. A dominant spouse doesn’t want that, so they're going to do whatever they can to create division between you and your lawyer, or whoever it is that's a positive influence on you and your case. My role is to ensure you have a voice and that your rights are protected. Part of the process involves helping you recognize when your spouse’s assertions are self-serving or inaccurate. Empowerment during a divorce can be transformative, both legally and personally.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022failingBehavior\\u0022\\u003eFailing to Adjust Behavior\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce often puts a spotlight on your actions, which may be amplified due to the situation. Missteps, like excessive drinking, continued infidelity, or reckless spending, can be used against you, particularly in custody or financial disputes. For instance, if you’re in a custody battle and you have a drinking problem, now would be the time to cut back on drinking. If your behavior raises concerns about your ability to parent, it could significantly impact the court’s decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivorce is the time to focus on presenting the best version of yourself. Address any habits or behaviors that might be detrimental to your case, and understand that everything you do during the divorce process may be scrutinized.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022financialDisclosures\\u0022\\u003eMishandling Financial Disclosures\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFinancial transparency is non-negotiable in a divorce. Whether it’s concealing assets, downplaying income, or failing to disclose upcoming financial windfalls, any attempt to mislead your spouse can derail your case. The discovery process is designed to uncover hidden information, and even a small omission can lead to deeper scrutiny. Opposing counsel will question your honesty, which can undermine your credibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo avoid this, be upfront about your financial situation from the outset. Full disclosure not only builds trust but also ensures a smoother process and better outcomes.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAvoiding common mistakes can help you better navigate the challenging process of divorce. Be honest with your attorney, focus on your own well-being, and trust the professionals you’ve hired to guide you. By staying transparent, listening to the right advice, and avoiding behaviors that could harm your case, you will be better positioned to work toward the best possible outcome. Remember, the decisions you make during your divorce will have a lasting impact on your future, so take the time to make informed, strategic choices.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Lying or Withholding Information\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#withholdingInformation\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Listening to the Wrong People\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#wrongPeople\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Allowing Power Dynamics to Persist\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#dynamicsPersist\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Failing to Adjust Behavior\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#failingBehavior\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_4_title\":\"Mishandling Financial Disclosures\",\"_contents_list_4_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_4_link_id\":\"#financialDisclosures\",\"_contents_list_4_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":5,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Jonathan Tuggle\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/jonathan-tuggle/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Boyd Collar Nolen Tuggle \\u0026 Roddenbery Divorce and Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

The short answer? Yes. While many divorces end in settlement and never make it to trial, the decision to file first offers strategic advantages that shouldn’t be overlooked in case you end up there. I'm of the firm belief that if you arrive at a point where your divorce decision is final, be the first one to file. Ultimately, the timing is up to you. Some things to consider include:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#proceduralAdvantages\\u0022\\u003eProcedural Advantages\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#perceptionOptics\\u0022\\u003ePerception and Optics\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#psychological\\u0022\\u003ePsychological Considerations\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#matter\\u0022\\u003eWhen It Doesn’t Matter\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-921032\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Does-It-Matter\\u002d\\u002d1024x683.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Does It Matter\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022683\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022proceduralAdvantages\\u0022\\u003eProcedural Advantages\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFiling first for divorce places you in the role of the plaintiff if you end up litigating. From a procedural standpoint, you then have the opportunity to present your case both first and last to the judge. This is an advantage because it allows you to set the tone and narrative of the case and then reinforce your arguments during closing remarks. I always want to have the first word, and then I want to have the final word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis assumes that you are going the distance and don’t end up settling out of court. Statistically, the odds are that you are never going to see the inside of that courtroom. If you do, you'll be glad that you're the plaintiff, especially if the marriage has significant disputes over finances, child custody, or property division. Regardless of whether you settle or go to trial, being the one to frame the case first can create a favorable starting point for negotiations or courtroom arguments.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022perceptionOptics\\u0022\\u003ePerception and Optics\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFiling first can also impact how you’re perceived by others, whether it’s your spouse, the court, or your broader social circle. Being the one who initiates the divorce often conveys a sense of empowerment and control. As opposed to being seen as the spouse who was left behind, you may appear as someone who took proactive steps to move on from an unsalvageable situation. On the flip side, your spouse may find themselves needing to explain why the divorce was initiated, which could work in your favor if public perception matters to you.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022psychological\\u0022\\u003ePsychological Considerations\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nFor some, filing for divorce can be an empowering act. It signals a decision to take control of your life and your future. It can even be a race to the courthouse to see who files first. However, it is not like that for everyone, even if they know the marriage is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve worked with many clients who, for whatever reason, will not file, despite recognizing that divorce is the right choice for them and that filing first might be in their best interest. They just want the other one to do it. Often, this hesitation stems from deeply personal reasons—such as wanting to preserve their children’s perception of them, a respect for the institution of marriage, or simply an unwillingness to be the one to “pull the trigger.” Under the right circumstances, they may even be perfectly content to maintain the status quo.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022matter\\u0022\\u003eWhen It Doesn’t Matter\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nWhile filing first has advantages, it’s important to remember that most cases ultimately depend on negotiation and settlement. If both parties approach the divorce with the intention to resolve matters amicably and stick to that mindset throughout the process, it may not matter who initiated the filing. You'll negotiate a settlement agreement and the court will grant the divorce. Then, it won't matter who is the plaintiff or the defendant.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDeciding whether to file first in divorce is a significant decision that deserves careful consideration. Filing first offers procedural advantages, allows you to shape the narrative, and can empower you to take control of your future. The court is primarily concerned with equitable outcomes, regardless of who files first. That said, being the one to file can offer peace of mind, as it gives you control over the timing and allows you to choose your legal representation and strategy before your spouse has the opportunity to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll things being equal, I like being in an offensive posture more than a defensive posture. However, I understand that filing for divorce can feel like a daunting or symbolic step, and some people struggle with taking that first action. If that resonates with you, I encourage you to reflect on what’s holding you back. Filing first doesn’t guarantee a better outcome, but it often sets the stage for a smoother, more controlled divorce process. If you’re at this crossroads, let’s discuss your situation and determine the best course of action for your needs and goals.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Procedural Advantages\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#proceduralAdvantages\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Perception and Optics\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#perceptionOptics\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Psychological Considerations\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#psychological\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"When It Doesn’t Matter\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#matter\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Jonathan Tuggle\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/jonathan-tuggle/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Boyd Collar Nolen Tuggle \\u0026 Roddenbery Divorce and Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Georgia follows an income-sharing model. This means that you combine the income of both parents and that tells you what the child support should be for the household. These guidelines have been updated to reflect current economic realities and address gaps in the previous system. Here are the most notable changes:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eIncreased Income Threshold for Calculations\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nGenerally speaking, the amendment increased the amount of child support to account for the cost of living. Previously, child support calculations capped at a combined household income of $360,000 annually, so $30,000 a month was the cutoff. Families earning above this threshold relied on judicial discretion to determine additional child support, but there was little uniformity across the orders.\\r\\nThe new guidelines raise this threshold to $480,000 annually. While courts still retain discretion for high-income deviations, the updated model calculates a higher range of support and provides more standardized calculations for families with higher incomes.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMonetary Value for Parenting Time\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the most impactful changes set to take effect in July 2026 involves how parenting time is factored into child support calculations. There will be an automatic adjustment to the amount of child support depending on the amount of parenting time that each parent has.\\r\\nThe original design of child support arrangements did not factor in parenting time. Child support guidelines were based on a standard arrangement of parenting time, like a parent who only has the kids on the weekend. If that parent spends more time with the children, then, in theory, they should pay less because the parent with primary custody has the kids less of the time.\\r\\nUnder the new guidelines, there will now be a dollar value assigned to the amount of time that each parent has the children. This change is designed to reflect the financial value related to the time contributed by parenting, and will likely benefit parents with equal custody, which is currently the trend. This is fairly complex, so ask an experienced lawyer if you have questions.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eThese changes are specific to Georgia, but they reflect broader trends in family law across the United States.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022implications\\u0022\\u003eImplications for Parents\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe amendments bring both opportunities and challenges, depending on your role in the child support arrangement. While the changes will only be forward-looking and will not apply to past payments, it is likely to affect parents in multiple ways:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFor Paying Parents:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nIf you currently have a substantial amount of parenting time, the new guidelines could reduce your child support obligations. I suspect that there’s going to be a flood of new cases. Just by passage of the new guidelines, you may be able to ask for a reduction in your monthly payments going forward because the previous order didn't have a dollar amount assigned to the number of days that you have the kids per month.'\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFor Receiving Parents:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nOn the other hand, parents receiving child support should be aware of potential decreases in payments, particularly if the other parent has substantial custody time. Planning ahead for these potential financial adjustments is crucial.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFor Both Parents:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nThe increased income threshold provides more clarity and consistency for high-income families, but it also underscores the importance of accurate income reporting and detailed financial documentation. If you already finalized your divorce and feel that child support was undervalued, you may want to ask for a modification.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022nationalPerspective\\u0022\\u003eThe National Perspective\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThese changes are specific to Georgia, but they reflect broader trends in family law across the United States. Many states look to one another when revising their child support guidelines, often adopting successful models. For Georgia, this shift may bring it closer in line with other states that already account for parenting time in child support calculations, and it may also serve as a model to influence other state’s decisions on the topic.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nGeorgia’s amended child support guidelines represent a significant shift in how financial obligations are calculated and enforced. These updates aim to create a fairer system by standardizing calculations at higher income levels and recognizing the financial contributions of shared parenting. They may also lead to a surge in child support modification requests as parents seek to adjust their obligations, and could have a profound impact on families across the state.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Key Changes\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#keyChanges\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Implications for Parents\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#implications\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"National Perspective\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#nationalPerspective\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":3,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Jonathan Tuggle\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/jonathan-tuggle/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Boyd Collar Nolen Tuggle \\u0026 Roddenbery Divorce and Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

You can attempt to make changes later directly with your ex, or, you may be able to request a modification through the court. Property division is not typically modifiable through the courts. On the other hand, child support, alimony, and custody arrangements can be modified if there is a material change in your circumstances.

This means the court’s order dividing property is permanent, and you won’t have the ability to go back and request changes later. While the parties could voluntarily agree to changes outside of the court, that rarely happens. This finality highlights the importance of carefully negotiating and assessing property division during the divorce process. If you’re unhappy with the proposed terms, address your concerns during the proceedings.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eEven in areas where changes are allowed, the process can be complex\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022childSupport\\u0022\\u003eChild Support\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUnlike property division, child support can be modified under certain conditions. To the extent that there is a material change in circumstances, you can go back and try to modify child support upwards or downwards. Examples of meeting the threshold to request a modification include a change in someone's income, a change in the needs of the child, or a change in the amount of parenting time that each parent is exercising. The court will evaluate the situation and determine if an adjustment is warranted.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022alimony\\u0022\\u003eAlimony\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nAlimony, or spousal support, can also be modified if there’s a material change in circumstances, such as job loss, a substantial salary increase or decrease, or an unexpected injury or illness. It is important to note that you can go back and attempt to modify the amount, but you cannot modify the term. For example, if alimony is set for five years and you want to ask for a change after two, you might be able to increase or decrease the amount, but you will still have three years left.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022custodyParenting\\u0022\\u003eCustody \\u0026amp; Parenting Time\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nCustody arrangements can be revisited if a material change in circumstances affects the child’s best interests, such as one parent not meeting their custody obligations. It is also possible to modify parenting time, like visitation days. Courts generally require at least a two-year gap between modifications in this area, unless there are exceptional circumstances.\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThe decisions you make now regarding property division, child support, alimony, and custody will have lasting impacts. While some changes are possible, divorce agreements are difficult to modify, and the effort can potentially be time-consuming and expensive. Property division is final and cannot be revisited through the courts, but modifications to child support, alimony, and custody arrangements are eligible to be reviewed if your circumstances have significantly changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re in the midst of divorce proceedings, it’s critical to address any concerns or disputes thoroughly and thoughtfully, rather than rushing to settle. By negotiating effectively and evaluating your options for litigation where necessary, you can help protect your financial future, maintain stability for your children, and avoid unnecessary legal challenges down the road.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Property Division\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#propertyDivision\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Child Support\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#childSupport\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Alimony \",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#alimony\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Custody \\u0026 Parenting Time\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#custodyParenting\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Jonathan Tuggle\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/jonathan-tuggle/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Boyd Collar Nolen Tuggle \\u0026 Roddenbery Divorce and Family Law\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/dl-member/boyd-collar-nolen-tuggle-roddenbery/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":2,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Here’s how to navigate this difficult process in a way that benefits everyone involved.\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#separateEmotions\\u0022\\u003eSeparate Your Emotions\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#professionalSupport\\u0022\\u003eSeek Professional Support\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#realisticParenting\\u0022\\u003eCreate a Realistic Parenting Plan\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022#modelHealthy\\u0022\\u003eModel Healthy Co-Parenting\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone size-large wp-image-921040\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-to-Divorce-and-Not-Ruin-Your-Kids-1024x682.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022How to Divorce and Not Ruin Your Kids\\u0022 width=\\u00221024\\u0022 height=\\u0022682\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022separateEmotions\\u0022\\u003eSeparate Your Emotions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the most critical things parents can do during a divorce is to keep their emotions about their ex-partner separate from their parenting responsibilities. While divorce often comes with feelings of anger, betrayal, or sadness, it’s vital to shield your children from these emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nKids can sense conflict, and when parents speak negatively about each other or let their emotions seep into interactions, it places an unnecessary emotional burden on the children. Instead, use outside resources—therapists, support groups, or even trusted friends—to process your feelings. This allows you to remain emotionally available and supportive to your kids.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022professionalSupport\\u0022\\u003eSeek Professional Support\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nTherapists play a crucial role in helping families navigate divorce, especially in high-conflict situations. Therapy provides a space for parents to process their emotions, transition into single life, and learn effective co-parenting strategies. It can be an important tool for managing the stress of going through the divorce process, allowing parents to decompress and be better equipped to be there for their kids. Therapy can also help children navigate feelings of being caught in the middle and develop coping mechanisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nParents might also benefit from parent coaching or co-parent counseling, which are goal-oriented approaches that offer guidance on how to advocate for your kids’ needs during divorce proceedings and work through parenting plan negotiations. When conflict escalates and the court becomes involved, parenting plan evaluations or parent coordination may be ordered to establish a framework that prioritizes the children’s well-being.\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eWhile divorce may end a marriage, it doesn’t have to destroy a family.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022realisticParenting\\u0022\\u003eCreate a Realistic Parenting Plan\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA well-structured parenting plan is vital for ensuring stability for your kids. Ideally, both parents will work together to create a plan that focuses on the children’s needs, considering factors such as their age, developmental stage, and preferences. The best way to approach this is with an open mind, with respect, and with an understanding that the children have two parents. It's going to require collaboration and corroboration, and that can be really challenging. While there are online templates for parenting plans, involving a professional can help mediate disagreements and foster a cooperative dynamic, especially in high-conflict situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s important to approach the process with an open mind. Many parents initially assume that decisions will be quick and conflict-free, only to realize that compromise is necessary and it takes time to emotionally adjust. Patience, flexibility, and a commitment to the children’s well-being are key.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022modelHealthy\\u0022\\u003eModel Healthy Co-Parenting\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nYour kids will do better with two great parents. The goal of a healthy divorce is for everyone—parents and kids alike—to come out on the other side feeling independent, confident, and secure. For the adults, this means being able to co-parent respectfully without letting contempt or past grievances dominate interactions. For children, it means maintaining strong, loving relationships with both parents without being placed in the middle of conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to transition from being spouses to more of a business-like relationship, and the goal of the business is raising your kids. If you can maintain a friendship with your ex, that’s great. However, being friends is not necessary to have a healthy co-parenting relationship. It is even okay to dislike your former spouse and recognize that they failed to meet your expectations, but also accept that they might be (or may be able to become) a great parent.\\r\\nAn example of a positive post-divorce environment is one where:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eParents can communicate about their kids respectfully, even if they don’t get along personally.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eChildren feel safe and supported, without being exposed to parental disagreements.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eParents have a reliable support system outside of their children.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFinal Word\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nDivorce doesn’t have to ruin your children’s lives. With careful planning, emotional restraint, and a commitment to collaboration, parents can ensure their kids grow up happy and well-adjusted. While divorce may end a marriage, it doesn’t have to destroy a family. Treat the process as an opportunity to model resilience, respect, and love for your children, ensuring their emotional health for years to come.\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Separate Your Emotions\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#separateEmotions\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Seek Professional Support\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#professionalSupport\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Create a Realistic Parenting Plan\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#realisticParenting\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"Model Healthy Co-Parenting\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#modelHealthy\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"Danielle Levy\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags_0_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"Family Psychology of East Cobb\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags_1_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"Top Questions\",\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_title\",\"bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":{\"title\":\"\",\"url\":\"/learning-center/top-divorce-questions/\",\"target\":\"\"},\"_bottom_tags_2_tag_link\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags_tag_link\",\"bottom_tags\":3,\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Here today we have Rob Roseman, a divorced dad to three kids, former Las Vegas Poker Pro, founder and operator of WTF Divorce, one of the most popular and cult-like brands. Podcast and Instagram with 167,000 followers. That helps make divorce a little bit easier and a hell of a lot more fun.\\r\\nWelcome Rob.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Thank you Devon. Good to be here. That's quite an intro. I'm gonna bring you around as my hype man. I like that.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So let's get right into it and start with the questions. Rob, you walk a tight rope with your humor angle with WTF and the brand that you've built. How does using humor help both you and your audience cope with the challenges of divorce?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Devon, I come at everything from like my point of view, and when I went through my own divorce in 2020, it was just, it's very overwhelming and there's a lot of negative energy. And as somebody who likes. Comedy likes to laugh at the ridiculousness of life.\\r\\nI thought, is anybody seeing this shit? This is a crazy amount of stuff for a person to handle. And at the end of the day, while we are going through a divorce, we're still human beings. We still like to laugh about it. And when I decided to create WTF divorce, and even the name was like playing on that thing that we all need some levity when we're going through.\\r\\nReally horrible isolating time. And so I find it important to inject that into everything I do with the sarcastic and relatable angle. So it's like comedians, like the darkest stuff. If you can tell jokes about it, I find it to be more relatable. More accessible, because we can only handle so much negative talk about our divorce.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Clearly, you had great foresight, and you hit a nerve. Have there been any drawbacks, comments from people being turned off, or is it all just this cult-like following that you've created, where everybody bought into it?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: No, absolutely. And that's, that is the one, the good thing about starting on social media is you only have four followers, and it's your mom and your best friend.\\r\\nSo nobody talks. But as we've grown, we'll see the comments can get very heated. I can't believe you posted this. How are you making light of this? My ex abused me, blah, blah, blah. And I think that's people's right to say that Everybody can say their own thing, especially on social media. You're anonymous.\\r\\nYou can put it out there. But I think overall it's well received, and I always, I'll tell people like, Hey, we're not for everybody. If you wanna unfollow us, I understand, but we are pretty sensitive to keeping a balance. This is not just dark comedy all the time. It's inspirational.\\r\\nWe just like a spoonful of sugar every now and then helps the medicine go down. But yes, there is a lot of pushback. Sometimes I'll screenshot the comments and be like, look at this person. They just wrote me an essay about a meme I posted, and I get to laugh about that.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Interestingly, the next question is somewhat related, so you may have addressed it, and you may wanna enhance your answer. Balancing humor and sensitivity, divorce is a sensitive topic. Understatement. How do you ensure that your humorous approach remains respectful and doesn't minimize the pain that many feel?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah, again, I think it's like you're not gonna hit 'em all, but we're always coming from a place of empathy and things that we've gone through. A big thing we do on WTF divorce is we involve the audience. So we'll ask a question, we'll be like, even yesterday, what's the biggest mistake you made in your divorce?\\r\\nAnd we'll get hundreds of responses. And by sharing them, this isn't like stuff that I think, this is stuff that other people think. It really increases the relatability of it. I'll get messages that are like, oh my God, I went through that too. Or, my ex did that, too. Or I'm feeling the same way.\\r\\nSo I think just being mindful that, like these are people going through real stuff, but also if you just try to. Not push the edge at all. It gets bland. It gets boring. So you wanna look, people are on social media to be entertained, to be distracted from real life.\\r\\nSo every now and then, you've gotta push the line a little bit. But yeah, in my comments, I've learned to respond like, oh, I'm sorry you're going through that. Or, sorry, you were offended by that. We don't hit on all of 'em. So we try not to be abrasive, but. I learned when we tried to tone it down or mute the humor, it just loses its edge, and then we're not really helping anybody because nobody wants to see it.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So you've spoken with hundreds, if not thousands, if not gotten feedback from tens of thousands of people. What is the response from the WTF divorce community regarding the use of humor in addressing divorce-related issues?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Oh, we get messages every day. It's the most rewarding part of what I'm doing is thank you so much for sharing this.\\r\\nI've never heard anybody else gets it. None of my friends or my family get it, so it's been a resounding thing. Sometimes I'll even put a question box: how has WTF divorce helped you? And we'll get hundreds of responses. It makes me feel less alone, helps me laugh at the insanity, knowing that somebody else gets it.\\r\\nSo yeah, the response has been fantastic. And I think you're gonna hear from people on all sides. We're all gonna have bad days. But I think our point is just to consistently be there as like your wingman, your best friend that gets it, because that's the one thing going through divorce is nobody really understands it unless you've been through it.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: What's super interesting about that is it's almost like a counterbalance. There's all this output that you put out there, and people have on a face with the various people they're fortunate enough to speak with about their divorce, and you seem to be this. Counterbalance for people, this window into something that really balances out something that's obviously really painful.\\r\\nWould you say there's any truth to that?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah, totally. And again, I love comedy, so you always look at like how a comedian writes as jokes and they want to like, it is that contrast, that counter. So it's like when your ex says the worst thing you've ever heard to you. But if you can make a light about it, all of a sudden, like you can sit with it better, you can understand it better, you might not, I always say we're not trying to, if we can make you 10, 20% less frustrated and driven crazy by your divorce, then we're, we're providing a a service.\\r\\nSo I think, yeah, it's finding just like the absurdity of all of this, making fun of it. And I think, I don't know about you, but like that when we're going through life as crazy as it is. If you can't laugh about it, you're gonna be, you're gonna be crying all day.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Got it. So here@divorcelawyer.com, we look at a lot of stats.\\r\\nThen there's the human side of things. And so one of the loose stats you being an expert to validate or dismiss is that two-thirds of women initiate divorce.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I don't know if it's anecdotal, but I've heard as high as 80%, and I've heard even like college-educated women could be up to 90%. And look, as somebody who started a WTF divorce for divorced dads, I quickly learned that.\\r\\nMost of the audience is divorced women. They're thinking about it for a lot longer. Guys are just going through the motions a lot of times. I know I'm generalizing here, but in general, yes, I think women have spoken with their friends. They've done more research, they've gotten in touch with themselves more, and yeah, it does seem like men seem to be more blindsided or they were more okay with what was happening. And women are coming at it from a more proactive angle a lot of the time.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So you've got this cult like following, and while you're here to address the masses, I know just from people speaking about the brand that you've built, that one of the things that people appreciate is that you also take a very individual approach with one's feelings where you can.\\r\\nI think that's super interesting and leads to the next question, which is addressing male isolation post-divorce. So there's all this attention on females initiating things, but studies indicate that divorced men often face increased isolation, leading to higher rates of depression and suicide. How do you address this issue within your community, and what advice would you offer to men struggling with loneliness after divorce?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah, that's a good question. And again, it is why I started this whole platform was because as a guy, there was nobody talking about this. It was just in the shadows. None of my friends were divorced, and if they were, there was very little talked about. So yeah, it's important for me, while a lot of our content seems like it's geared towards women, and I get a lot of comments from men saying what about us?\\r\\nEverything is about women here. I think men go through a uniquely painful way of dealing with it, where we isolate ourselves, where we self-medicate with drinking, drugs, sex, there's just a lot of we're not really doing the same work, and we retreat. So I think I don't know if it's, I've seen statistics where I'm sure male suicide rates are higher in all men, but I think after divorce and a life change, maybe your kids are taken away from you.\\r\\nIt's just a really hard thing for guys. So I think speaking about it, the fact that I'm on camera talking about it, so you're seeing another guy talking about it. Again, I got into this whole space coming as a dad, and I used to have a dad podcast where we talked about our other dads going through it.\\r\\nThey're not talking about it. Even more extreme with divorce. And, we've got our kids, and then we don't. So I think it's important to just normalize that men are going through this, women, you're gonna be dating men that are going through this. Your ex is co-parenting your kids. So it's like important to be involved. The guy's perspective in this and that's something I just didn't see a lot of.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So one of the other things that people recognize about your brand and your following is that it's humor-led, but you've been known and outspoken about, oh, also being resourceful. So, for example, coping strategies beyond humor.\\r\\nHumor might be the direction, but we also need to make a concerted effort to offer people tangible takeaway-type things, because once they leave your ecosystem, they're back in the real world. So beyond humor, what coping strategies have you found effective in navigating the emotional challenges of divorce, and how can others implement them?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah. So, besides humor, look, a lot of what we're doing is connecting people with experts. I am not an expert. I'm the one going through it. So I came into it like a lot of guys from how do I start dating? So I found that there are dating coaches. So there's resources where we're sharing a lot of content from other experts.\\r\\nI think it's important to educate yourself, and today, 10 years ago, you had to read a book, which you would've never done. Now you can open your phone and listen to a podcast. Again, finding these resources can be very overwhelming. So that's one thing we try to do is almost aggregate. And make it easier for you to learn these things.\\r\\nAnd then, if you're interested in going deeper, do that. But, dating, something most people haven't done in 20 years. Co-parenting, it's one of the trickiest things you could do. This person that you ended a relationship with, maybe not on good terms. Now you've gotta have day-to-day interactions about the most important part of your life - kids. I certainly didn't know how to do that. I can't imagine anybody else did. And it's a constant, a learning process. You need the reminder almost more than you need to be taught that there's gonna be hiccups. So I think it's important to constantly be learning and learning from people that are smarter than me or that have walked in my shoes.\\r\\nSo I think it's important to spend some time when you're feeling frustrated or you're feeling lost, look for resources, and that's an important thing as we try to. Mix it up where we're always sharing different topics to hopefully hit on the one that one person is looking for.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: One of the things I personally have always found interesting about what you've done is that you seem to hit on and unlock this potential for people to embrace.\\r\\nHumor and divorce. It's okay. It doesn't mean that you're not taking it seriously. It doesn't mean that you don't understand the gravity of it, but it's a single mirror component that can have more weight than the singularity of it being a component. Would you say that's true?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah, I think the way a message is communicated is everything, it's like the hook on tv.\\r\\nWhy do you watch the show? Why do you open the email? It's like you need to be mindful. If you tell somebody that your ex is a narcissist, here are five things. It's just, it's not gonna be received. I enjoy marketing. I enjoy persuasion, and I'm like, how can somebody get across a message? A lot of times, you're great at this with humor and disarming people, and then all of a sudden, we're paying attention.\\r\\nA lot of my energy is like, how can we get this really sensitive, important topic so somebody will listen and think about it and dig a little deeper. And that's a hard thing. And I think a lot of professionals you see that are excellent at their work. Lawyers, financial advisors, they're experts in their craft.\\r\\nAnd what we try to do is help them get that message across, and maybe that's through a meme, or maybe that's with editing, where the first thing they say you've caught your attention. I find when I do a lot of podcasts, people are talking about their credentials and how much they help people and people have checked out by then. So I feel like it's our job to help these professionals connect in the most effective way with the audience that they want to help.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Awesome. So, last question. And I think an important question, because by definition, well by definition alone, these days of being human is lonely.\\r\\nGetting divorced has to feel. As we know, the range of emotions and so you having spoken with so many people, we here at divorcelawyer.com are very curious about your answer. Rob, on the following question, so what would you say the common threads are of those going through their divorce journey?\\r\\nWhich really starts the conversation about everybody's an individual, but let me just tell you pretty much if there's an answer, what it is that we've seen from the community. What is that common thread or threads?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah, it's a really tricky thing because. You crave connection. You crave somebody to listen to and somebody that understands it.\\r\\nBut a lot of times in real life, those people are not to be found. Your family might live somewhere else. Your friends are married, they can't hang out. So you still want to connect with people, but you don't know how. So I actually have found, and while I have my issues with social media and all the tech that we use.\\r\\nWhat do they say You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with? For me, a lot of that is online. Who am I following? Who is, who can relate to what I'm going through, who can teach me things? So I think it's important to find your people. And when you get divorced, a lot of those old friends, you might, they might have moved on, they might side with your ex.\\r\\nThey might not really care, your family. They might have your best intentions. They might say, oh, screw your ex. And that's not really helpful when you're trying to build a new life. So I think there's that constant feeling of isolation and overwhelm. And I think today with podcasts and Instagram and just all of the resources, you can start to cultivate like your new life, your new foundation.\\r\\nAnd I think it is important to put yourself out there in the real world. Whether that's through dating, whether that's through going to the gym, joining activities, all things that you probably haven't done in 30 years. You need to take baby steps and a lot of that. I think the easiest way to do that is through online, because you'll start to find your people, you'll start to find your voice, and then that can give you more confidence to enter this new life, because look, a big reason we get divorced, whether you chose it or not, is to this inflection point in your life. You've got this new opportunity to be your new self. So take advantage of it. It's not easy. It's gonna be very clunky at first. I always tell people it gets worse before it gets better, but even hearing things like that from people that have gone through it, I think is very important because you can get caught in this kind of like resentful oh, you'll meet somebody, or, oh, this, you didn't wanna be with them anyways. And that can drive you even more crazy. So I think it's very important to find your people. And if those people are online and you've never met 'em, that's a great place to start. And it'll set your trajectory in a, it'll, point your ship to somewhere that you want to go to.\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Amazing, amazing insights. So, Rob Roseman, why don't you let everybody know where we can find you?\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Thank you, Devon, for being on here.

We’re building the world's largest educational resource and community dedicated to divorce. Great big day. Today, we are joined by the one and only Rhonda Noordyk. Hi, Rhonda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Hi!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Rhonda Noordyk is a well-respected divorce financial strategist. She is known internationally for her work in pioneering a path for women to navigate through the financial aspects of the divorce process. As a strategist, Rhonda helps her clients determine their next best financial move. Today, we will explore what a certified divorce financial analyst is. The financial questions to ask yourself on your divorce journey and how do you know if you should hire a certified divorce financial advisor analyst? So, hello again, Rhonda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Hello. Thank you so much for having me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: You're welcome. It's great to see you. So let's start with the obvious. Let's start with an important question that I think a lot of people just don't know the answer to. And that is, what is a certified divorce financial analyst?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: That's a great question. Right. And you know, it's interesting because the CDFA is definitely becoming a lot more known. Right. One of the things that I think is important for people to understand is it is an area of specialty. And so for people that are going through divorce, a lot of times it's like, hey, I have a financial advisor, I have a financial person. But at the end of the day, right, it has become very clear to me over the last 10 years, and I've been doing this specific work only with people who are going through divorce. The details matter. And I was on a call yesterday actually with another CDFA and were kind of brainstorming, and one of the things he said was, Rhonda, you know, isn't it interesting?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery single case we have to analyze, look at, think through strategically, how we could best handle or position it. It's not black and white. It's as much of an art as it is a science. Right. And so thankfully for me, I've had 10 years of doing this specific work, plus 12 years in the financial industry to be able to draw on, to say, hey, okay, we did this in another case, what about this? Or what about that? Or let's go back and ask this question. I would say that most CDFAs are affiliated with a particular firm, a wealth management firm, and most CDFAs do about 10 cases a year. So they're kind of dabbling in it, but it's not an area of specialty. For me. I do about 10 times that a year. I've been doing it for 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bring a lot of knowledge and experience to the table. And I've also realized I'm not a good neutral. So there are some people who are like, Rhonda, I just want a neutral person. I'm not a neutral. I'm an advocate, and I'm usually an advocate for the person who is. There's an imbalance of power, and I'm usually working with the person who is on the lower end of that scale, helping work to come to a level playing field so that they get an equitable distribution from their divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So, all that said, how is it that people miss finding this crucial step?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: You know, it's interesting, right, because that's a good point. I think a lot of times people think, hey, I need an attorney. And so that's where they start. And the attorneys are like, hey, well, we've been doing this, you know, for. For years, decades. We handle the legal part of that is, you know, this financial piece. They're not really financial experts, but, you know, they're like, hey, well, this is what we do. Right? And so the. Unfortunately for the attorneys, a lot of times they become the, you know, the legal, financial, and emotional people because they're the only person. And so then, you know, it's hard to sometimes, I think, separate those boundaries. But the amount of cases. I mean, there was a case I was working on. This was early on when I first started my business.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working with an attorney, and I had come to the table, I had reviewed the marital settlement agreement, and there was an issue in the MSA that I was concerned about. And what I was concerned about was the statement said that there was not, you know, if and when there is a pension discovered, the client would get half of it. The problem with that is, first of all, how do we discover it if we already haven't discovered it? And secondly, if he dies prior to her getting her portion of the pension, she gets nothing. And there's no divorce police that come after the fact. So I went back to him. I said, listen, I'm feeling very unsettled about this. And unfortunately, between the time that I reached out and the time that he got back to me, the client had signed the agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I said, I'm not okay with this. I said, can you go back to the company and get a statement that does, in fact, say that he does or doesn't have a pension? Everybody's saying he doesn't. Can we get a statement from the company that says he doesn't have one? And he was like, fine, I'll do it. So he writes a letter, sends it over to the large company. They get back to him and said, yeah, this dude's got a pension. And so. And so I'm like, okay, that's a problem, right? So they end up amending. They ultimately ended up avoiding, you know, a client complaint because that was a big mess.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd my client now is protected that if the husband passes, ex-husband passes away, you know, before she receives that, she will get a payout of her report, her half of it. So, you know, those are the kinds of things where it's like, oh, well, it'll be fine later. And I deal with a lot of times seeing on the back end, right, all of the issues that it's like, how do we avoid that? How do we make sure that we're doing that correctly? So going to bat for my clients is something that, it's the core of who I am. I can't leave it at the door. I'm going to advocate for what's right and I want stuff done, you know, accurately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I can say from when we met months and months ago, before I even got to know you, or exactly what it is that you do, that was the exact feeling. Take charge, advocate, passionate. That's your true north. In addition to, I mean, 10 years is a long time to be focused in this one area. So my takeaway from what you just said, and for the benefit of our listeners, is that what you reference is a detail to start a conversation, is anything but a detail. And in the end, oftentimes either, okay, there's no action to take, or there's action to take, and in the end, it was the opposite of a detail. Would you say that's accurate?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah, absolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: All right, so let's get into the bulk of it. And so the question is, what financial questions should one ask themselves on their divorce journey?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: There's some good ones. So speaking high-level first, I think one of the biggest questions that people often ask me is, Rhonda, how do I get a fair settlement without taking my spouse to the cleaners? That's the exact terms. And I'm like, I don't even know where that originated from. It makes me chuckle because you're like, I don't know what the cleaners is, but okay. But ultimately, I think that's the question, right? A lot of times, people come to me and they want things to be fair. They want us to be equitable, but here's what I would say to that. At the end of the day, Devin, the numbers and the calculations, the output in the calculators are only as good as the numbers we're putting into the calculator. And those are subjective.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Would you just say that one more time for our listeners, please? That was huge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So the numbers, right? The output in the calculators, the output in the spreadsheets are only as good as the numbers we're putting in, and the numbers are subjective. So the question then becomes, what are we using for income? If we're talking about support calculations, for example, are we using their salary? Are we including the bonus as part of that conversation? Are they a business owner? What are we using for their income, right? Are we using, are they taking W2 income, meaning they've got, you know, a payment, right? Like a pay, they're on payroll. Are they taking distributions out of the company? Like there's so many moving parts with that. So we got to first dial in what is the income?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the other part of it is the non moneyed spouse oftentimes is tasked with either getting a job or going through an evaluation to say, hey, we recognize that you haven't worked for 10, 20 years, but we're about to value on what you could be working, what you could be making so that we can use that as part of the calculation to really ultimately offset what you're getting in support. I think it's ridiculous. I get where it's coming from. But you know, to say that somebody's going to go back into the same job that they've been, you know, 20 years ago, like I had a client, she was like, oh yeah, I did web design 20 years ago. I'm like, 20 years ago, was there even web design? I don't know. But like, you know, like it does not look the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they're like, oh well, she could be making, you know, 80 grand. And I'm like, in what world? Like she's got to go back and first of all get retooled if she's even going to go back in that space, or decide what she's going to do. I'm like, well, she could be working at Starbucks for 15, you know, $15 an hour. It's like, okay, whatever. Like, at the end of the day, that those are the types of things that I see. So, you know, what are we using for income is a really important question. The second thing is how do we evaluate what's fair when we talk about property division. Because kind of along those same lines, what are we using for the business valuation? What are we using for the rental properties? The valuations? And people might think, well, yeah, isn't that easy?\\r\\n\\r\\nLike we just, you know, Zillow it or we just get a fair market value or. But it's so much more than that. And then the subset to that is, okay, are we going to be dealing with capital gains issues on the back end if the primary property is sold, and what does that look like? And same thing with investments. Are we going to be talking about a capital gains or loss issue that needs to be addressed or accounted for? How do we navigate through that? I mean, it is a lot, and I think a lot of times people want to go to, well, we're just going to start, you know, he's going to keep this and I'm going to keep this and. Or she's going to keep this and I'm going to keep whatever it is, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm like, okay, we can't be horse trading anything until we get a clear picture of where things are at because they're all interrelated completely, right?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Completely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: And once we get the information, then it's okay. How are we negotiating this? And I know for me, like, a lot of times people are like, well, Rhonda, you only work with women, so you must hate men. That could not be further from the truth. I actually was working with a client she was dead set on. My husband's an alcoholic, I'm the higher income earner, I'm done with him, and I don't quit, and I don't care if he's homeless. And she was so serious, and her actions were in alignment with that. She was willing to basically take every. Try to take absolutely everything and leave him with nothing, and all that to say, Devon, we parted ways because I was like, I can't get behind this. I am fighting for there to be some level of, you know, equitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot like we're going to just take him out at the knees and like, peace out. So I think a lot of times people misconstrue where I'm coming from. There's a lot of times I'll often say, okay, what is important to your spouse? Not because I'm advocating necessarily for them, but that's an important part of the conversation because anytime we're engaging in negotiations, it's what am I giving? And I think unfortunately for women, they're like, well, I'm giving, I'm giving. They're Gonna. They're missing the question, what am I getting in exchange for what I'm giving you? And I think if we could start to, as women, do a better job of negotiating and asking that question, what am I? I'm willing to do that, but what are you going to give me in exchange for it?\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause a lot of times when they're asking for things, hey, I'd like to keep the house, or I'd like to be able to keep this. What happens is they come back with a list of questions that say, yes, I will do that. But here's all these contingencies of things that need to be met in order for me to do the one thing that you're asking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So it sounds to me like a really important part of your job is framing things for people. Just the. The aspect of framing, how they might view this beyond themselves and the different ways will make your process that much more effective for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Agreed? Yep. Absolutely. And like, I just had a conversation yesterday with a client. I had convinced her that we needed to do a couple of key things that were essential to helping her bridge the gaps in information. And she didn't really want to do it at first. She was taking her spouse's word at face value. And I said, we just don't have enough information to substantiate what he's saying. And so we did it. We had a conversation yesterday. We moved the needle about $500,000 as a result of asking the right question, framing it appropriately, and bringing in any additional ancillary experts that we may need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Got it. So, at what part of the process do you usually meet these people on their divorce journey, and is it with them directly? Is it normally through an attorney? Where in the process?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So I love this question. When I first started my business, it was in what I call the messy middle. Everybody was reaching out. They're like, oh, my gosh, Rhonda, my attorney's not calling me back. This is a disaster. I'm being asked to make decisions. I don't know what I'm doing. And certainly there are today those people that reach out. And as long as there is a reasonable time period, I can still help them. However, a lot more people are reaching out because they're considering it, and they want to be prepared. So the sooner that we can be involved, the better. Like I often tell people, listen, you can pay me now or pay me later. The price is going to be the same, if not a little more. So get me involved early on, and I'm going to help you. Find the right people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe're going to build the team, we're going to review the financials and gather and organize the documents in a way that makes sense, and do micro opportunities of education along the way, identify the gaps in information, make sure we've got full transparency, which people think is automatically going to happen. And it doesn't like a gap income, a gap in transparency, a gap in expertise. So it's what I see there. Then we dial in the data where we're talking about property division and support guide to finish strong on the marital settlement agreement. Making sure we've got the eyes dotted and T's crossed there. Kind of like the story I shared earlier. And then the exhale, which is, okay, it's over, and now what? How do I wrap up those loose ends and move forward?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ultimately, what I just described to you is my bridge method, my signature method that I've developed over the last decade that isn't just, oh, I woke up and thought I would try this. Like it's been tested and measured, and it works. So we walk them step by step through the process and then women come out on the other side more empowered, more clear, and they're in a really good position to start this next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Amazing. So as I'm listening to you, I'm thinking, okay, one of the most serious life events, one of the most stressful life events, and dollars and finances are a black and white topic. However, I would think there's a very nice emotional component to working with someone like yourself to know that you are being thorough. Is there an emotional component you found that you're clients have in going through this process, or is that just in my head?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: No, it's definitely emotional, and you know, kind of to your point, I think that's the thing. Like people think, oh, this is black and white. It's going to be just, you know, we're just going to divide everything down the middle. And it's just so that's so far from the truth. And I think the emotional component comes in a lot of different ways. Women and men, we're bringing our own baggage as it relates to money to the table. So our attitudes and beliefs about money that we've developed over the years, we bring to the table. Sometimes it's they're afraid of debt, they're afraid of being on their own, they're afraid of, you know, making bad decisions around the finances. There's a host of things people are just, it's related to fear. But then, also we have an opportunity where there's a lack of confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so the lack of confidence comes from really two things: having the knowledge and experience to be able to have the confidence to make good decisions. And there's a gap in that. And I always say, like, the knowledge, if we have the knowledge without the experience, it's theory. If we have the experience without the knowledge, it's trial and error. But when we get those two things working together, it's super powerful. And that was really based on a Prudential study. They did a study in 2000, they did another study in 2010. And while it sounds like, Rhonda, that you know, data is outdated, it really isn't. I've reviewed that report many times, and I don't think things have shifted nearly as much as they probably need to.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what this takeaway from that study was basically, listen, at the end of the day, women lack confidence around money. And so, you know, and then you layer in some situations, there's a lack of transparency, there's a lack of access to information. I mean, there's many times where women haven't signed the tax returns. They, you know, maybe paying the bills, but they don't have any idea of where the big picture is on the financials because they've been told, hey, don't worry about it. And so now they're faced in, you know, now they're in a position where they have to face it and they have to deal with it. And many of them, while they're afraid, they want to, they're like, Rhonda, I want to be empowered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo one of the things we've started saying is, okay, instead of going from how do I go from a fair settlement, to how do I go to an empowered settlement? And what does that look like? Because empowered means, hey, I'm engaged, I am interacting with the conversations. I'm making good decisions. Not just, hey, I'm hoping for something, and the chips fall where they're made. I hope I get that's fair. And a lot of times, people, particularly women that are in, you know, higher net worth situations, the people will say, oh, don't worry, you're going to be just fine. And what that means is we don't know, right? Like, how do we define what fine is? And why is it their job to tell you that you're going to be fine? Like, we have to define that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so I think at the end of the day, the word fair is one that in the divorce space, everybody's like, well, Rhonda, you can't get fair. I'm like, that doesn't exist. And that's. I think you can when you define what fair is. And it doesn't always mean 50. It means being engaged, being empowered. If you're giving something in exchange, you understand what you're doing. And for me, that's a win. Like, that's a win for my clients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Big time. Big time. So, if I've hired an attorney already and I found you on divorce lawyer.com, and I see this interview and he or she hasn't brought up the possibility of working with somebody like you, how does one handle that if they see the value in all that you're saying?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Absolutely. I mean, I always encourage people to reach out, you know, and we can have a conversation because I think at the end of the day, there's usually a way that we can help as long as we have time. The tricky part is, hopefully, they haven't spent way too much time, money, and energy. But, you know, at the end of the day, right, we still have time to make sure that we are helping people have those empowered settlements. But the sooner that we can get involved, the better. If people already have attorneys, that's no problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will often either work behind the scenes, kind of being that advocate for my client to empower them to show up for those conversations with their attorneys, or I'm often part of the meeting if they want me to be, so I can play whatever role people feel comfortable with. I'm totally fine being the secret silent weapon behind the scenes, you know. And it's not because I'm afraid to. It's just I'll play whatever role. My ego is not that big that I'm like, yeah, I have to be in front of. I'm okay being behind the scenes, but also I'm very confident in being able to have those conversations and be part of those conversations if people want me to do that as well, and take a more active role as the team.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Got it. Got it. I think that's very helpful because people are going to see tons of benefits here and then sort of wonder internally, like, we all do well. How do I make this happen if it hasn't been suggested? Okay, great. That's helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I will say this, Devon, that, you know, basically my take on that is, as long as you haven't signed the MSA or the final agreement, we still have time, okay, well that's if they reach out. I'm like, I don't even want to look at it because I'm going to find all these things that I'm going to wish that you would have asked me about, and there's nothing I can do about it, so I don't want to say it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Okay, great point. So lastly, you know, how do you know if you should consider hiring a certified divorce financial analyst?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So I would say for me, because I'm not necessarily like, I'm not investing the assets, right? I think a lot of times, you're like, oh well, you should only work with the CDFA if it's a high net worth case. And I say that's ridiculous because I think again, because I'm looking at it from how do I empower my clients? I feel like everybody that has been married for longer than five years and has kids needs a CDFA, and that's a little bit different than maybe what other people have been told or whatever. Like, oh, I don't need that. Because the issue is if we oversimplify, we don't know what we don't know. And so that's where the biggest landmines are. And over the years, I have developed an opportunity for people at all levels. I work privately with clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also have a, what I call a group experience where I'm taking people through my bridge method in a way that is educational, focused, and yet they still have access to be able to ask questions, learn, grow it so we can grow with them as they're going through the process. And then if they start with our group experience and they want to be able to say, hey, listen, I feel like I need some one help, they can always unlock the opportunity to work one with me in more of a limited scope way so I still can have my eyes and ears on their situation, give them input, feedback, strategy, you know, and it's not only just the one. So we've been able to adjust our model over the years to be able to address that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause not everybody needs the one, you know, high touch. Some of them just need some direction, some guidance, some step-by-step from a proven system. And I can help them with that. And it's filling my soul because I actually used to teach in higher education. I was an adjunct faculty for 15 years. I develop ed curriculum, was awesome, and I now can do that within my own business, you know, being able to help people navigate through this process.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Very unique.

We are joined today by the one and only Cindy Stibbard. Cindy is a Certified Relationship and Divorce Coach and a leader in her field. Today, we will explore what a certified divorce coach is, the questions to ask yourself before leaving a relationship or divorce, and how do you know if you should hire a divorce coach? So welcome, Cindy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Thank you. Yes, it's a pleasure to be here, and I'm really excited to be connecting with your audience. And I know this is such a well-needed place that you offer people to come and be educated in what's a very scary decision, or a very scary world or even prior to making a decision. So, thank you for doing what you do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Absolutely. Well, thank you for that because I don't think there's enough vulnerability going around. I think we all struggle with similar things, certainly people contemplating or going through divorce. So, to hear from an expert like yourself is really helpful for our audience. So let's start with the most broad question. What is a certified relationship and divorce coach?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yes. So when I was going through my divorce, I was overwhelmed by the amount of women that were reaching out to messaging me privately, acquaintances that I had said, oh, wow, I didn't realize, you know, you were going through a divorce, you were that unhappy. What are you doing? How are you navigating it? Because I'm thinking about it too. And I realized during that time that there were so many women who were struggling with making that decision. And I thought, there's got to be a better way for me to help people than just sharing my own experience. Like, there's got to be something in education that I can do so that I can really steer these people in the right direction, give them the support they need without. Without becoming a lawyer, without going back to school and becoming, you know, a therapist.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I was able to do training and schooling in becoming a certified divorce coach. And so I do have a certification. I do have a variety of certifications, actually. If anyone wants to know them, they can go over to my website @ \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cindystibbard.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003ecindystibbard.com\\u003c/a\\u003e but what a divorce coach does, the way that I can best describe it is we sort of fill that gray space between, in therapy, you've decided it's no longer working and you want to get divorced prior to jumping and getting a lawyer is that person that sort of bridges the gap between, I think I'm making this decision, but I need to know for sure how this is going to go do I want. Is this. Is divorce right for me? Is right now a good time for divorce for me?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are all the things that I need to consider before I go and retain a lawyer or what kind of lawyer do I even retain? Because, as we know, not all lawyers are made equal. And I'll not. And not all paths to divorce are meant for everyone, either. And so a divorce coach is really to figure out what is the right path for you now, and how do you take that? Because when we don't necessarily know that on our own. And so my coaching and my training and my experience is all around how to help you now, what you don't know in this very vulnerable, very confusing and overwhelming time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Terrific. You actually started to address my second question, which I think is a common one, and that is, what is the difference? Let's drill down on a few things, if we could. What is the difference between a therapist and a divorce coach? Now, being in the business and hearing from people, the way I see it, they're very different. Very different. But people tend to just cobble together. I need one or the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I think you actually need both, especially if you're going down or considering the path of divorce. I mean, a therapist to me is like going to the gym for your body right, or eating well. You need that person in your life who's constantly getting you to grow in your mind to unpack all your childhood stuff. As a divorce coach, we're not going back to the childhood. We're looking at where you are right now in your relationship and how do we take the right steps to move you forward and what that looks like for you. And you're going to likely need a therapist through this experience as well, because they're going to need to help you understand who you are and why you've got here where you are and going back into the old patterns of your marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas a coach, yes, I'm here to also navigate that emotional piece, but not to go in a place that's going to unpack all of those psychological issues that you might have from the past or things that you're working on. We're going to look at where you're at right now, how to navigate emotions as they arise, and what to expect moving forward. And also the difference, I think, between a therapist and a coach is I'm here to really hold you accountable for change. I'm not here to just listen to how you feel things should be or how it lands for you, but to really make it clear the direction that you need to take so that you can actually feel differently, do differently, be different. Three months to six months from now. I don't want us to be in a.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a relationship where you're still working with your divorce coach two years later. You know, we need to have a defined outcome in terms of transformation, goal setting, really change that needs to happen, that is too scary to make on your own. And so as a coach, that's really my job is to guide you and hold your hand when it's hard, when it's scary, when you don't think you can. Not just to listen to you, but to show you the way. Does that make sense?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: It makes complete sense. And when we first met, as we're getting to know each other better, there were two things that struck me. One was your obvious passion and clarity for what you're doing. I mean, this is. And we speak to a lot of people. This is absolutely your true north. The second thing I can tell you that I felt immediately was that as much as we all run businesses, that you're selective and you're not a yes person. And it seems like it's really important that someone finds someone like yourself that obviously possesses those two things, because you're not there to necessarily tell people what they want to hear all the time. Is that right?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Oh, my gosh, yes. You. You nailed it on the head. And I think I'm. I'm. I guess I'm a very compassionate, very empathetic person, but I'm also a little bit of a school of tough love. You know, I'm going to be that best friend that tells you what you need to hear, because you need to hear it, and you don't want to hear it, but you know, you need to. And so my job is to share that. That truth with you and help you move forward, because when we get stuck, it's usually in a place of fear. And our therapist is there to help us come to our own conclusions, but your coach is there to help you come to the conclusions and the answers together. And I love what I do. I feel like you're right. At 49 years old, I found.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found my calling, and I'm here to really help people through this very difficult part of life, because I went through it, and I wish that I had someone like a me when I was going through it, too, because I would have made so many different choices had I had someone to shed light on what I didn't know or how I didn't, how I wasn't seeing through my emotions in a rational way. And so when you have that person beside you who's seeing, making the visible or the invisible visible, and who. What I like to say is I have a rational brain. When my client's rational brain isn't working, you know, I'm there to help you see what you need to see and then take you there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: And that isn't a judgment, it's an observation. It's quite the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah. All in all, in the pursuit of helping your clients and saying that too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I just want to add one more thing is I feel like people who feel like, oh my gosh, I can't work with the divorce coach because I'm not ready to get divorced. And I think that's the beauty. And maybe what sets me apart from the average divorce coach is that my role, what I really do is work with people who are just considering it, just contemplating it. Neither. I don't want to push you one way or the other. You know, divorce is not my agenda. It's for me to really shed light on what would divorce look like for you? What would the vision of your life actually look like if you were to get divorced? And let's even break it down so granular in terms of financially, what would that look like? Sharing the kids between two homes, what would that look like?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow would it feel? How can you envision what your life could be? And when we don't create that plan and that vision, then we are so much more fearful of that path of divorce because we have really no idea what that looks like. And so I'm not here to judge you one way or the other. If you want to stay or you want to go, it's completely up to you. But my job is to open you up to the possibilities of both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Super helpful. So that sets the next question up. The central question, which is what are the questions you should ask yourself before leaving a relationship or divorce? There's so much. So what are the things there are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: There are so many. And I have a 20-question sort of inventory on my website that people can go download that really takes you a little bit deeper. But the three high-level questions I always like people to ask themselves is one, you know, what are your values or your core values being met in this marriage? Like, are you truly being met where you need to be met? And is that, let's say your core value is honesty and transparency, and maybe emotional intimacy? Are those things being met for you? Maybe your core values are financial security and personal development and growth and family. Are those core values being met in this marriage? If they're not, then considering why that's not happening. Is it the difference of personality?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs a difference of values just in terms of a fundamental foundation with your partner? Can you build on it? Have you communicated this? But to see, sort of, first of all, are your core values being met? Secondly, I like to ask my clients, you know, what is the purpose of you being in this marriage? And we all have different reasons for being in a marriage or keeping a marriage going, right? It might not be the fact that you're in love anymore, and this is your person, and it's like, you know, this beautiful, overwhelming honeymoon. Your purpose might be, I want to grow wealth with someone. I want to build with someone. Your purpose might be, I want to have a family with someone, and have extended family with someone. So really look at like, what are you here for?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the purpose of this for you? And then the third question I like to ask is, what is your long-term vision for this marriage? Because if you can't see what that future is really clearly, and if that's not a future that you're excited about and that you really can't wait for, you know, when the kids grow up and they're off to college and it's just you and your spouse left, what do you see in the future for the two of you? And if that doesn't make you feel at least a little bit warm and fuzzy inside, then ask yourself, really, maybe the future vision I have for this marriage might be stopping here. Maybe my role and their role in my story is ending and might end here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo those I know are really high-level questions, but they start to get you thinking deeper about why you're where you are at and what needs are truly being met in terms of the reason behind this relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I love your number two answer on purpose because we hear from so many people in our community that, you know, you're born into a set of circumstances and marriage is just the next. It was just the next thing, it was without really questioning, without being wise or maybe mature enough to question. But I did it because that was just the next thing that was expected of me. Is that something that you uncover quite a bit?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So much. I feel that when we're young and we make a decision to get married, the reasons that we got together in the first place are likely not the same reasons that we're still there now, We might have gotten together because it was the person that I knew. We were friends, and then we just kind of liked each other and then got in a relationship, and the next thing was marriage, because everyone was doing it and where our families expected us to. Or I felt like my clock was ticking and so I better do it because I'm getting older to have kids. And then we don't have the same stresses on our relationship back then as we do now. And so the reason that you could get into a marriage could be. Well, I came from a really.\\r\\n\\r\\nA really financially struggling family, and my partner was very well off. And so for me, that was a safety net. I mean, I'm speaking even of my own personal story here, but for me, that was a safety net. At the time, that was what I needed. And then as that changed and grew, and as that became more solid in. In myself, your needs in the relationship change, and now you're going deeper. I need someone who can be a partner with me, who can be emotionally connected, who wants to raise kids. And then you start seeing where your true differences lie. And so I think when we're young, we don't see it because we're just not in it. We can anticipate all these things, but we don't really know what.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the world is going to be like 20 or our lives 20 years from now. And so you see a lot of people get to this place where they've grown in different directions. You know, I don't like to say they've grown apart because it's not necessarily that. It's just that they've grown now in different directions and need different things. And so it's a matter of, is there enough real foundation here with this person that I can see that I want to grow with, despite all of the differences that we might have now? Do I see that this foundation is strong enough? And just because a marriage ends, to me, does not mean that it failed. It just means that you might be graduating onto a different part of your life, that this person is no longer matched for that part of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, I don't see it as a failure at all because it was a success for the time that it lasted. And I think we need to start to celebrate that part a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yeah. So you're in Vancouver, is that right? Yes. So what is it? What is the driving age in Vancouver?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Well, my son's age, so 16. He just got his learner's license, and he's starting to prepare for his Road test. And at 17, you can become a full independent driver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I have a 21-year-old, 19-year-old, and a 14-year-old myself. And as you're speaking, it just came over me. We all as parents kind of feel like, isn't that a little bit too young, 16, you know, to start driving? When you're talking about something as important as serious as a marriage, and you think about all the development that we do as individuals and all the stages that we've been through, it's almost a similar sort of thought. Like, there's just a lot that goes into this decision, and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't, and that's just okay. But it almost feels like sometimes we get married too young without really knowing what to contemplate ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Yes. And that's when that comes into the purpose. What is the purpose of me getting married to this person right now? You know, what is this going to change in terms of my life? Because you don't need to have necessarily that ring on your finger for this to be a commitment. And a commitment that you're going to have for a long period of time, and especially if you have got kids, that's far more of a commitment for life than it is to be. To be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Right, right, right. So one of the questions that we get a lot. Drilling down for a sec, one of the questions that we get a lot from the people in our community is, am I emotionally done and ready to move on, or am I just overwhelmed?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: This is interesting because I actually just made a post about this yesterday on my Instagram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Oh, you did?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: And it talks about. About. Right? Yeah, it talks about when we get to the point where we're no longer angry, you know, when we're no longer fighting to save the relationship, but we just become quiet and almost indifferent. And if you get to that place of indifference, meaning I'm neither here nor there in this relationship, that's when we're true. Then it's truly over because you've slipped into this place of complacency and almost roommate syndrome with this person, you know, and. And it becomes a matter of what am I here for? Am I here out of fear or am I here actually out of love? And that's when we need to start going deeper in terms of what does this really mean for me in my future?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if, I mean, in my opinion, if you love someone and you know that you are no longer in love with them, the greatest act of love is to let them go so they can Go and find the love that can love them better. But if you are holding on out of fear, then let's work on that. What are you afraid of? What vision do we have to create, and what reality do we have to get really right with so that you can become more comfortable with this decision? But I do feel, you know, women are classic in this way. You know, if your wife is still fighting with you, she's still in the game. The moment she's done fighting, that's when you've got to start worrying that maybe it's too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: That's a great barometer. I mean, so again, answers how therapy is so different from what it is that you do, because anybody can choose to take action and navigate things successfully. But am I seeking to escape or am I seeking to grow? And yeah, it seems like you're at the intersection of really helping people out with the answers to those and probably many more important questions so that they can determine what their next step is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Absolutely. And sometimes divorce is right for them. But divorce, right, it might not be right now. They might need to get a few ducks in the row and to, you know, have a plan and to become educated and more knowledgeable in the divorce process and how it works, and even their financial world at home in their marriage before they can make that decision. Now, maybe your kids are very small infants. Let's say I had a client last year working with me, and she had a one-year-old, and she was pregnant, and she was desperate to get out of this marriage. And let's keep in mind, like marriage, it doesn't have. It wasn't abusive, it wasn't in a situation where it was unsafe for her to be there. She was just emotionally done.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at that stage of the game, we have to start considering what's best for the children at this point, because you know that by law, you're likely going to have to share this infant child with their father. Are you comfortable and ready to do that with a newborn? And I. Even though you might know that this marriage is no longer for you and even your husband might know to a certain extent what's best to do right now as you're in those early stages of really young kids? Because we have to also do what's best for them. Are you putting them in an environment where you're struggling so much that you can't actually support them the best that you can?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So it's the opposite of one size fits all. Every single case is unique to themselves and their set of circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: So unique. Yes. And then getting them set up with who's then next in line to support you. You know, I mean I'm part of the process definitely, and can continue when the divorce starts. But I want to make sure that, you know, I'm directing them to where they are going to best supported. What kind of lawyer, what kind of mediator, what kind of financial expert so that we can create a team around people. You know, there's, I love that we're trying to break the mold of the lawyer is the only person that can help you in divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we're now realizing that the best way to navigate divorce in the most cost effective way and the most timely way is to round your surround yourself by people who actually are experts in all the different pieces of the pie, you know, and that is how we can survive this easier and thrive afterwards. Both sides. You know, there's no winner in divorce if someone is losing, you know, and.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: It's such an insecure time. It strikes me as a huge benefit of working with someone like yourself is the emotional component to know that you're not alone and that you have guidance, even if it's in support of others beyond what you do. Lawyer, financial person, et cetera. I think that'd be a huge benefit that people would miss out on in their process.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: I think it is really key, and if we want to navigate it in a different way, we have to start making different choices. And I think that it starts here, you know, and I only learned the benefits of doing that by doing it myself when I was heavily overwhelmed with the divorce process, realizing that if I kept reaching out to my lawyer every single time I got triggered by my ex husband, I was going to be broke and living under a bridge after this divorce. Because they're not my therapist, they're not my coach who's talking me off a ledge to say, listen, let's get clear on what you're feeling right now before you decide to make this a very expensive, costly decision for yourself. And who else can be involved in here with this? A financial person. Let's get this part really clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause not all lawyers are also accountants or financial people. And that's okay too, right? We have to get those right supports, people in place. And I think that so much, so many people don't realize that, and that it seems like a lot of cooks in the kitchen. And I know divorce is expensive and it's like, well, how many people do to pay but at the end of the day, sometimes by paying all of those people will be less than if you just paid one to try to do all those jobs that they don't really know how to do that well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Massive advice. That's a huge point. So how do you know if you should consider hiring a divorce coach? Is a divorce coach for everyone? Based on the benefits that we discussed, we could probably be here for another 10 hours and still have time to talk about all of the benefits. So the real direct question is, how do you know? And as a divorce coach for. For everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Great question. Really great question. I think that it starts by when you're contemplating divorce. You know, if I mean, for me, that's. That's really where my niche is. There are lots of divorce coaches who also just do the process or just do the recovery afterwards. And so it is a matter of what kind of support do I really need right now? Am I scared of divorce? Is my therapist, you know, here to help me with my emotions? But I'm not really getting clear on what divorce looks like. And so this is when a coach like myself could come in really handy for you in terms of. Let's get super clear. What does divorce mean for you? What could that look like?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you are doubting or you're feeling this whole, like, I don't know, I always like to say the phrase, like, if you are saying to yourself, I don't know, you need to hire yourself a coach, because once you hire that coach, you'll know one way or the other what's right for you. And a divorce coach is not here to, you know, push divorce on you. They want to see that you are making the right choice. That's the best for you, whether that's divorce or not. It becomes really clear working with a divorce coach, because that's what we're focused on. The longevity or the future of this relationship, not how we got here, not why all this occurred. We're not going to go and unpack that. That's for your therapist. It's for right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been feeling in limbo. I feel numb. I feel confused. I feel untethered. I've lost myself, and I don't know what I really want. That is when a coach can really help you get clear on where your relationship is at and where you stand in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Terrific. So, Cindy, please let everybody know again where they can find you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: You can find me over at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cindystibbard.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eCindyStibbard.com\\u003c/a\\u003e, or I spend most of my time over on Instagram at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.instagram.com/cindy.stibbard/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003ecindy.stibbard\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e: Cindy Stibbard, Terrific.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eThe DivorceLawyer.com Podcast with Cindy Stibbard, a Certified Relationship and Divorce Coach\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nContact Information - Find Cindy online here, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cindystibbard.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eCindyStibbard.com\\u003c/a\\u003e or on Instagram here, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.instagram.com/cindy.stibbard/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003ecindy.stibbard\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022alignnone wp-image-921294 size-medium\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.divorcelawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DivorceLawyer.com-Podcast-with-Cindy-Stibbard-Certified-Relationship-and-Divorce-Coach-300x169.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022\\u0022 width=\\u0022300\\u0022 height=\\u0022169\\u0022 /\\u003e\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list\":\"\",\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

Tamar shares strategies for protecting children’s emotional well-being, setting boundaries, and improving communication with a co-parent, especially when trust and respect are strained. She emphasizes the importance of honesty without oversharing, using tools like co-parenting apps to reduce conflict, and keeping divorce details within a close circle to minimize gossip. Tamar also offers practical tips for managing transitions between homes and reminds parents that co-parenting is best approached as a business-like partnership focused on the children.\\r\\n\\u003cdiv style=\\u0022padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003ciframe style=\\u0022position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\u0022 title=\\u0022DivorceLawyer.com Podcast #4 - Tamar Burris, Certified Relationship and Divorce Coach - Lowering Expectations About Co-Parenting\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/video/1095012211?h=f64a926945\\u0026amp;badge=0\\u0026amp;autopause=0\\u0026amp;player_id=0\\u0026amp;app_id=58479\\u0022 frameborder=\\u00220\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cscript src=\\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/script\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eHIGHLIGHTS\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAvoid sugarcoating.

I am your host, Rob Roseman. And today we are lucky to be joined by Tamar Burris. Tamar is a certified relationship and co-parenting coach. Her motto in working with two-family homes and divorced parents is co-parent without blame, shame, or games. Tamar, thanks for being here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Thanks for having me, Rob. I really appreciate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRob: This is the stuff people don't really think about during the divorce process, but right when those papers are signed, this is, I always say this is when the real fun begins, and when you quickly realize how working with a professional is so important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It's true. And really, if you can think about it ahead of time, you know, I know everyone gets really wrapped up in this whole divorce process. Getting the lawyer, getting to know what comes next. But before you even talk about divorce with your soon-to-be ex-spouse, if you can start talking to a professional about what this might look like afterward, it's really helpful to do that from the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's very smart. So let's hop right into it. We've got eight questions that we've got a lot from our audience, and that we see a lot. So let's go. Question number one, Tamar, what is the biggest mistake you see parents make when trying to shield their kids during a divorce?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's a good one. The biggest mistake that I see parents make when they're trying to shield their kids during a divorce is probably to sugarcoat a lot of the things that are happening. I mean, not that you want to tell your kids all the nitty gritties of the adult stuff, but you also don't want to pretend that this isn't changing, that this isn't happening, or that mom or dad didn't react in a certain way, or that, you know, life isn't hard right now. You really want to be open with them about, yeah, this is a change, and this is hard for all of us, and we're going to get through it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And along those same lines, how do you see, like, what's the nuance between protecting your kids, and I'm sure a lot of parents end up putting their kids in the middle of the process. Any stories you've seen with that, and maybe things you can work through? It's probably a natural feeling when you're having all of this conflict, and your kids. How do you see that play out?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It happens even to the best of us sometimes. We want to be great parents. But here we are in the midst of this situation, and we want to make sure that we are being authentic and honest, and you know, and all of a sudden, here we are oversharing with our kids. And that's a big problem. We put our kids in the middle, or there's conflict between us and our, you know, our co-parent. And so we're just going to talk to our child and make them deal with it. Oh, you have to be responsible for this. And you tell Dad this, or you tell Mom that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what happens is that we're, we're doing what's called parentification, and we are adultifying our kids, and we're making them too old, and then we're making them responsible for things that they don't need to be responsible for. And I see it specifically or particularly, I guess, with my clients who have teenage kids, where they think that teenagers can handle things and that they should be told more. And it's still totally inappropriate. And you know what, it's even inappropriate when your kids are adults. You don't want to overshare with your children. No matter what age, they are still part you and part their other parent, and they don't need to be in the middle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I've seen a lot of parents are frustrated where Mom's like, oh, Dad cheated. Or Dad will say, oh, Mom did this. This is the reason why we're divorced. And when there's that frustration built up, any tips on like how a parent can communicate or even not communicate those things that's just bubbling inside of them?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, well, I mean, the biggest is don't communicate that, right? Kids don't need to know again, no matter how old they are, young, teenager, adult, they don't need to know the nuances of what exactly split this marriage apart. Because the truth is, even if dad cheated or mom cheated, you know, stuff led up to that, right? There's stuff that happened in the marriage that probably made it possible to have that door open. Not saying it's your fault, but you know, there's a lot of it that takes two to tango, and the kids don't need to hear any of it. So keep it away from them. This is the stuff that you talk to your therapist about. Maybe you're a very trusted best friend. You also don't want to share it around the community because you don't want your kids to hear it from somebody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don't want them to hear it at all. Now if they are aware like mom or dad had an affair, now they're immediately living with someone or something, they then, you know, you can have a conversation if they want to talk about it, but you make sure that they are the ones that want to talk about it, not you. And you ask questions instead of giving them information. If they say, you know, dad's living with so and so, did they have an affair? Well, what do you think? And what does that mean to you, and how do you feel about that, rather than imparting how you feel and what you think on your children?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I hear you say that a lot. Listening, asking questions. Almost the less you say, the more impactful it can be. You brought up a good question. A good point here too, when you hear other people talking about it. So let's say your kid's in high school and they're saying, oh, I heard your parents got divorced because of this or that, and that must affect the kids. And then the kids come home and talk to you. How do you deal with that kind of gossip around divorce and kids?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It's really hard. I mean, for you, if you can keep it as close to yourself as possible and keep it in a tight little circle, then hopefully there won't be as much gossip. But you can't control what's happening on the other side. Gossip does happen, and gossip hurts. So I try and help my clients look at this as a lesson, right? Your kids are going to high school. They're going to hear gossip. They might hear mean things about themselves. So in this case, it's about divorce. So, how do we teach them to be strong? How do we teach them to think critically? How do we teach them to look for the people who are supportive, you know, and you want to just take the lessons that you would, whenever there be gossip and apply it to that. Okay, you heard this from some of your friends. How do you feel about that? And why do you think your friends are saying that? You know, whether it's true or not, should your friends be saying that? Are these the people we want to surround ourselves with? Why or why not? You know, and teach them sort of stay away as much as possible from the actual facts or the actual information about the divorce that's going around, and just give them life lessons about gossip and about a supportive community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What would you tell a child, maybe a younger one, especially where a kid comes at them and says, oh, I heard your parents are divorced. They don't know. We don't know what to say. Expecting them to say, I'm putting you on the spot here, but a really simple script or something they can use to deflect or respond when a kid is kind of picking on them about this topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, well, I mean, it depends on the child, right? It depends on their personality. But honesty is usually the best and the easiest way to diffuse any of that. So if you tell your child, okay, well, how does that make you feel? And they say, it hurts my feelings, you know, and I'm sad that you're getting divorced, we'll tell this other kid, it hurts my feelings when you say that, and I'm sad that my parents are getting divorced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that'll probably shut them up real quick. They're not expecting that. That kind of mature response. All right, next question here. How can you co-parent with somebody who you don't trust or respect?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's really hard. And we often start at the end of a divorce with that idea of not trusting or respecting this person. And the thing to remember is that time shifts our relationships, right? So five years from now, you might trust them more, you might respect them more, you might not, but you might. So just know that. Give it time, and things will work out. The thing is, with co-parenting, you really only have to trust them with your children. You don't have to trust them with your heart. You don't have to trust them with things in your life. You don't have to trust them with your bank account. You don't have to trust them with anything but your children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I know our children are important, but if you can look at this sort of objectively and say, are they a decent parent? Are they feeding my children? Are, you know, are the kids sleeping okay? Do the kids still go to school? Are the grades suffering? You know, do the kids seem like they're doing all right and surviving at dad's or mom's house? Or have they been coming to you with major problems? You know, as long as the co-parent is meeting the minimum for your children, then you have to trust them on that level. And that's the only level you need to trust them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's a good, helpful reframe because I think we conflate all of the things that we can't stand about the partner, former partner, as if they're also not the best parent. And it's like, well, they might be terrible at this and they might have done this, and they can't do that, but they are. They do get a B minus in parenting. So it sounds like you have to, like, figure out a way to untangle all of those. Those feelings. Can you give us a few like phrases or language shifts divorced parents can use to improve communication? Reduce tension. When it gets really heated and you're in that moment and you're just flooded with cortisol, like things you can say when you know, we're like, I wish I had tomorrow on my shoulder to help me respond here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, nine times out of ten, when I meet with a client after they've had a conflict like that with their co-parent, they're like, gosh, I wish I didn't say that, or I wish I just left that one alone. But I couldn't help myself. So, so my. I think that the biggest thing I would say is take a moment and step back. If you can give yourself a pause, that's what you need to do. Pause that text, pause the in-person conversation, pause whatever it is, and you can say, I need a minute. Just walk away, take a little walk, take some breath, calm down. That is the easiest way to shift how you're going to show up. You need to show up without emotion. And when you're heated like that, it's really hard to control what you're going to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. Especially over text. You get the ping and you're like, oh crap, who's it going to be? And then you look, and then you're, how dare you. So I think it's even harder in today's world because we're programmed to respond so quickly to text, and we get triggered. It sounds like you're saying, don't respond to anything in the first place. Even 10 minutes can help you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You don't have to respond right away. You know, unless it's, there's some sort of emergency like our child is in the hospital, and all you need are the details. I'm going right. Nothing else is really an emergency. So give yourself a minute. Give yourself 10 minutes. Give yourself 20 minutes. And this is where I think when you talk about texting, this is where the co parenting apps are so helpful because if you have someone who's constantly barraging you with messages and you're getting really overwhelmed when you have the messaging on that co parenting app, it's a way to sort of keep it away from yourself and you can check it when you want to, but it's not just perpetually in your faith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I know. We're both big fans of \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ourfamilywizard.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eOur Family Wizard\\u003c/a\\u003e, and that's kind of an underrated thing. It's just text is so just reactive and quick and urgent feeling to have Something that's like, you've got to open it up to see the message. It just slows down that. That loop that can really spiral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yup, slows the role, and it helps you stay calm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. What would you say to a parent who feels like they're doing all of the work and the other parent just isn't showing up?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that happens a lot. And I don't want to, you know, wholly generalize because it does happen to dads, too, but it happens a lot for moms. You know, there's like, he didn't do anything when we were married, and he's still not doing anything now kind of a thing. But I think that two things you have to think about. One is, who are you doing these things for when you do all this stuff, and the other parent doesn't show up? Are you doing it for you because you want to be a certain type of parent? Are you kind of controlling, or are you doing it for your kids, and you're giving them the best quality of life, and it's something that they need.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you're doing it for the kids, sometimes you just have to take a little breather and say, okay, this is what needs to be done, and someone has to do it. And so I'm doing it. And yes, you can be frustrated and you can be upset, but at the end of the day, you know that you're coming through for your kids. You're giving them what they need. They. The opportunities, the life that they need to have. You know, when I work with clients on stuff like this, we can. We set up situations to try and create change. So if someone says, you know, she doesn't ever come through, or he doesn't ever come through, and like, this big thing is coming up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI try and set up an action plan for them so that we can say, okay, text them the date that it's happening. Text them the thing that you want them to do. You know, very clearly, I need you to pay $300. She needs to be at soccer with the cleats, the uniform. At 10:00 am. Whatever it is you need from them, and you give them ahead of time, and then you give them two weeks before, and then you give them a week before. And you know, you keep messaging them about that, but very clearly, very specifically, and not throwing them under the bus. You don't want to come at them with anger and say, you never follow through. You never do any of this. It's your turn now. You know, it's just. No, this is what I expect of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is what needs to happen, and know that it might not happen. So it's up to you in your certain situation whether you want to let the other parent drop the ball a couple of times and feel the wrath of the child on that end. And maybe they can make a change, or if you want to, just continue picking it up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's such a good point. It really is like a skill that you have to learn because communication was hard enough when you were in a marriage that wasn't ideal. Now you're trying to do it with somebody who you probably don't have the best feelings for in the beginning. You're doing it now over text, once a week or every day. And I've seen, you know, with people on Instagram and things. And especially as a dad. When we throw in too many things into a message and can you do this? And can you also send this? Our brains kind of shut off. So I think it's a good tip to keep your messages as short as possible and as specific. Always say, maybe like one call to action, like, can you handle this? Got it. Thank you. And then maybe you send the next thing. But when we try to fit everything into a paragraph and send it to them, we end up getting. Getting nothing done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It's really overwhelming, you know? And that's. Even for you. That goes both ways. There are parents I see. They just bombard the other parent with this long litany of like, all the things that need to happen this weekend. I know for myself, I'm a multitasker and I try and get everything done, but just, I just blank out looking at that. It's too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, yeah, it is. And the other thing. The mistake that we all make is we probably start the message with like, something that's not the friendliest. So once you say, hey, you didn't pick up the kids last time, or now everything after that is probably going in one ear, out the other. We're defensive. So faking it even, or using tools like ChatGPT to like structure your message so it's short and actionable and on the friendly side, it's going to get you the result you want a lot more than what your impulse is that you really want to say 100%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And a lot of people get caught up in that. They're like, oh, but I. They need to hear this, you know, and they don't need to hear it. What you want is a win. And if you're going to win, you have to play nice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's so true. And winning a lot of times is not responding at all or responding with an okay or I got it, because you're not giving them that thing that they want to latch onto and fight back at. So sometimes it's helpful to reframe. It's like, let me see how few words I can say to respond to this. And then you start to feel confidence in that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Absolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Is there one thing divorced parents should never say to their kids, no matter how angry they are with their co-parent?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, yeah, there are a few. But one of the things I would say you never say to your kids, no matter how angry you are with your co-parent, is, I wish I never met that person. No, I wish I never married your mom or your dad. I wish I'd stayed away kind of a thing. Because you never want your kids to feel like they're unwanted or like they're the burden that's keeping you in this glue of something that you wish you could just run away from.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's a good one. And that is, we always ask on our Instagram, like, what's one thing that you take away from your marriage, one thing that you don't regret? And 90% of the answers are my kids. So it's helpful to remind yourself that they wouldn't even be here if you didn't meet this person.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. And most, you know, people, as you say, people feel that way, but in the heat of the moment, they also, you know, we also tend to feel the big regret of, like, gosh, what would my life be like if I didn't have. If I never met this person?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Absolutely. A couple more here. What should a parent do when their child says, I don't want to go to Mom. Mom's house. I don't want to go to Dad's house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's a really heartbreaking one. And it happens a lot. And one of the things. Well, first of all, you have to make sure that it's not a safety issue. Right. So there's that there's always the caveat, is this a safe environment? And so there's the question of, well, why don't you want to go? It's a really big question. What if something happened. You know what, why don't you want to go and try and get to the bottom of that? If it's, if it's just the normal situation of transition, is hard and we don't like changing from one house to the next. Then, dealing with that is different. And it's just sitting down and saying, I'm sorry, I know that this is really hard. Is there something we can do that will help you feel more comfortable going to Mom or Dad's house?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can we do? And brainstorm and spitball ideas with them and remind them that, you know it's hard and you know it sucks, but they have two parents who love them and two parents who want to see them and so that's why they have to go back and forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And I think also remembering not just for the kids, but for the co-parents that like transition 15 minutes or an hour is very stressful for everybody involved. So it's like they will be okay, probably in a few hours or a day. But like you said, things aren't always going to be the same as they are even two years from now with your co-parent. How they are right now might not be how they are in two hours once they're settled in their room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Absolutely. And generally speaking, like I said, as long as it's safe in that other home, you know, that is how it goes, is settle in and they're okay. And you think about how they transition back to you. You know, I know in my own situation and with clients that I work with, transition day is really hard on both ends. It's not just the transition out, but also the transition in. Think about your own self, right? If you're going on a vacation, you pack this suitcase. You don't know what to take. You usually overpack and then you show up in this place, and it takes a day or two to like really acclimatize to your hotel room, to the location, to whatever it is you're eating, you know, and imagine that's your life. Every week is like that, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you have not even 15 minutes or an hour, two hours. Sometimes you need a full day to just settle back in and remember your routine in this new environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I always say those transition periods, it takes a while to get used to this. You're going to butcher it your first hundred times trying it. But like the more you can systematize it, the less you can say to your co-parent. I know we try to like say all the different things, and it can add to the stress. So it's like even something as simple about is like, hey, would you mind if we talk about the rest later and not try to get it all in now? Because Timmy is A little stressed. So let's just get that done. Try to think about the child in that case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Absolutely. And one of the things I tell my clients a lot, too, is don't ask your kids questions when they come home. Don't ask about their time at the other parent's house. Let them just settle in and let them talk when they're ready, if they're ready. You might never find out all the details about what happens at the other home, and that's okay. They don't want to be interrogated. It makes it a lot worse, man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I can still remember being 10 years old and my mom asking, how was school? And you're just like, my eyes still roll thinking about it. So. Right. Imagine that on steroids with a kid switching houses a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: One last question. Kind of how you work with your clients, Tamar. How do you help your clients create better boundaries with their co-parent, especially when there's a lot of unresolved emotional conflict?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, it's fairly individual. It depends on the kind of boundaries that are needed. But generally speaking, there's a lot of pullback that needs to happen. Pulling back into yourself and letting go of expectations, and knowing that it's all going to be okay. But you cannot control what's happening in the other person's house or in their mind, and they cannot control what's happening in yours. So it's reminding yourself to have a shorter communication as we talked about. Right. Don't check in all the time. And that this is no longer really an emotional connection. This is a business connection. So we're just going to do what needs to be done, and then we're going to pull back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if the other person doesn't show up or if they don't come through in some sort of way, it's learning to let go and not ask and not expect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Very helpful. And as you said, you can't really see all this when you're going through the divorce process of and when you're working with your divorce lawyer. But it's important to educate yourself. And videos, conversations like this are very helpful, maybe even setting up time. Like, I know I'm getting divorced now. I'd like to schedule time with Tamar as a co-parent to see what this is going to be like. What's the best way for people to connect with you, Tamar?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTamar\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.

I am your host, Rob Roseman. Today we are lucky to be joined by Rhonda Noordyk. Rhonda is a financial divorce advocate for women. She has helped thousands of women and has helped get $25 million into the hands of women that would have been left on the table. I love hearing that. Rhonda, thanks for being on here today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Hey, thank you so much for joining me. Good to see you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: All right, Rhonda, we always have so many questions for you, so I feel like we'll learn a lot about what you do with the questions. So let's hop right into them. Rhonda, why do you think the financial gap post-divorce hits women so much harder than men?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So as I was thinking about this question, Rob, there's so much to unpack here, right? I think there's a lot of reasons, but really, there are multiple layers to this. I would say I want to focus on three key areas. The first one is really a lack of confidence. And I want to preface this by saying that it's not that women aren't capable. It's not that they're not smart enough. Confidence has nothing to do with that. The formula for confidence really is, hey, do you have the knowledge, and do you have the experience? And are those two things working together? So a lot of times women will say, oh, well, my husband handled the finances. Oh, he's super smart. Oh, he, you know, whatever, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at the end of the day, it's, they're relying on their spouse to be able to make those decisions because they divide and conquer, right? It's like, hey, I'll handle these things. You handle that. When we have the knowledge without the experience, it's theory. If you have the experience without the knowledge, it's trial and error. But when we get the two of them working together, it can be really powerful. So the first thing is, I think there's a lack of confidence. The second thing is I think that people are seeing what I call the damn method, which is where their soon to be X is dodging the disclosure, they're avoiding getting assets valued and they're misrepresenting information. And a lot of times, women are like, okay, what do I do about that?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it's understanding the process, it's understanding what questions to be asking. It's understanding how to push, what to push, and how much to be able to make sure that they are getting what they need. And then the last piece is I think that there are a lot of times where women are being bullied into making a decision in the guise of, let's just get this done. And I think a lot of times women think, I'll figure it out later. I just need to be done with it. And so they settle in areas that maybe they don't have to settle in. And unfortunately, they. They see the impact of that decades to come. I mean, when I first started my business 11 years ago, there were so many people that said, Rhonda, I could have used an advocate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere were you 10, 20 years ago when I was going through my divorce? Because, oh, by the way, they're 10, 20 years on the other side of it, and they're still seeing the impact. They're not being made whole. They're still running up the down escalator from a financial perspective. And it's a real problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's. That is. You almost hear a lot of people that have gone through a divorce say, I wish I knew this then. And that is why, you know, these videos, this kind of content can be so helpful if the person sees it before it's too late. You can always make adjustments, but we all know how much harder that is once those papers are signed. Some of the things can actually be impossible to reverse. So you see that a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, absolutely. And I always tell people, like, hey, if you sign the paperwork and I haven't had a chance to look, I don't want to look at it because I kind of feel like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to see all these things that I would have suggested that maybe we do a little bit differently. I'll give you a really quick example. I was working with a client, and of course, I work nationally, so she was down south. And at the end of the day, the attorney called an audible. In kind of the 11th hour, the case was supposed to go to trial. They decided that they were going to go to mediation. This was a Friday. They said, we're doing mediation on Monday. Rhonda, can you be there? I'm like, no, I can't be there on Monday. Like.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what I said to the client was this. We have prepared. She had her kind of best and worst-case scenario. She was empowered with the information. But I unfortunately wasn't able to be in the room. And so you can only do so much from a distance. And I don't mean over Zoom. What I mean is like not being present in the meeting, whether it's virtual or in person. So they went forward with the mediation. What I learned is in this particular state, they don't care if it's like, oh, it's a really long mediation. We just want to have everybody sign before you leave. Get it done. So she signed. And I had told her that day, I said, I'm going to be in meetings, but I want you to reach out to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will drop whatever I'm doing to review the document to give you input. I didn't hear from her, so I reached out to her the next day. She goes, oh, we signed all the paperwork. I'm like, oh, my goodness. Okay, send it to me. And it was a real problem because she got no alimony, she got a minuscule amount of child support, and all of the assets that she received were not accessible. And the other piece of this is this woman had lost her job because she was going through divorce, and her old employer paid her off to not sue them, so she didn't. So when we look at the income possibilities as far as where, and we'll talk a little bit about this, where can all the income come from?\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a lifestyle perspective, she is in a real pickle because she now has to go find another job and whatever. So at the end of the day, I was really upset about that because there were some definite things that the attorney believed, like, hey, I got her a good deal. And I'm like, you really didn't. You really didn't. Because she has access to zero liquidity, and she paid her attorney an obscene amount of money. Like, yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Oh, it's interesting to hear. And you unfortunately hear about these things, like you said, when they are too late. And, you know, this is a divorce lawyer.com podcast, and it sounds like even if our divorce lawyer is great and we feel confident with him, we can't rely on our divorce lawyer to handle all of these nuanced financial decisions by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I mean, I think having a team is really important. And, you know, there are really good attorneys. I work with many of them throughout the country. But I think the ones that are good, not just good, the ones that are excellent. There's a couple of key characteristics. One, they follow what I call my CIA method, which is they're communicative, so they respond to emails in a timely manner. They have integrity, and they're willing to advocate for their clients and work together as a team to be able to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think the ones that we've had good success with, they're open minded, they want to stay in their lane and do the legal, but they recognize there might be some other areas, and they're open to kind of linking arms that they know isn't going to be in the best interest of their client.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I read a stat, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard that women lose nearly twice as much of their lifestyle as men after divorce. Is that. Is that a true? Is that a stat you've heard?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It is a stat that I have heard. And in fact, that is the reason that my company exists. Is that exact stat? Because I think it's unacceptable. And I think there are ways that we can dial that in again before the paperwork gets signed to make sure that's not the case. So, you know, kind of along those lines, like, yes, it's true. And how do we deal with it? How do we address it? I think we have to demystify the data, which is part of my process that I take people through. And what does that mean? It means looking at property division and looking at support and recognizing that, like, hey, in both of those areas, it's not just a, hey, it is what it is. Oh, that's how we always do it. That's the status quo, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always said, hey, listen, the output in the calculations for support or the output in the Excel spreadsheets or in the program are only as good as the numbers we're putting in. So what are we putting in? And those numbers aren't necessarily objective. There is some subjectivity to it. So there was a quote by Simon Sinek that I absolutely love, and it says, those who fiercely defend the status quo do so because it benefits them. And I thought, how often do we see like, this is just the way it is because the person who's saying it doesn't want to fight as hard, or they don't have a strategy, or they're lazy. I mean, that's just the reality, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so I think that's part of it, too, is, hey, are we willing to challenge the status quo in an effort to be able to help women be in a better position? You know, one of my podcasts is called Disrupting Divorce. And the reason that I named it that is because I have always said, listen, there's gotta be a better way to do this. We don't just have to accept everything because that's what we're told. We can ask questions, we can lean in and engage in the conversation. And if that was the case, kind of to circle back to the intro, I would not have been able to move $25 million and growing into the hands of women if this was impossible, and quite frankly, Rob, I wouldn't still be doing this. Like, this is not the easiest thing I could be doing is every single day going to bat for women who are disempowered around the finances. If weren't getting wins, I would not still be doing this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, and I like that quote you said. It takes somebody that is disrupting the system. Because there's a quote I keep hearing a lot. Everything that's going on. I'll probably butcher it here, but you'll get the gist of it. It's impossible to convince somebody of something who benefits from not understanding it. And it reminds me of like, oh, I don't want to mess with it. Like, the system's working for me right now, so I'd rather even not even hear this. And it sounds like that's where you're really injecting yourself into these discussions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Here's a question we hear a lot. Why is staying silent during your divorce more dangerous than being called difficult?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You know, it's interesting because I think a lot of times women are afraid to speak up. And part of that is because of maybe the relationship, right? Their history with their soon-to-be acts and maybe some ramifications there, or they are feeling afraid or just uncertain about even what to be asking. So one of the things that I do when I'm working with my clients is I think teach them how to negotiate, how to have a voice, how to speak up. And I've always told them, listen, you don't have to come up necessarily, even with the questions to be asking. Sometimes I can help you and frame that, and then you can go ask it. And so I think it's again, giving them the framework to be able to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the exercise that I take people through is how they can negotiate. It's an acronym because I love acronyms. Everything's an acronym for me because it's a great way for us to remember. But the ANAT method and the not method says, hey, how can I tee up having a conversation in a way that's going to be respectful and yet have boundaries and make the ask? And so the way that this works is we say, hey, I want to acknowledge. So the A is acknowledge some aspect of gratitude, starting with something positive. And then it's naturally I, which is the naturally I, obviously you. And then what the ask is. T is the ask. And it could be something big, it could be something small.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the reason that this is helpful is because then when people are sitting at their computer or they're in the midst of a meeting, and they're like, I don't know how to respond to this. I'm being asked to accept a proposal, or I'm being asked to accept, you know, whatever, or I need my attorney to do something. So, like, for example, one of the ones that we often will talk about is around billing, right? Like, clients are concerned about having high legal bills or not necessarily knowing how to have a conversation. So one of the things I'll say is, okay, well, let's reach out to the attorney. I will help you kind of craft this. And they'll say, hey, thank you so much for representing me. Thank you for taking on my case.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, I want to make sure that I can pay my bills. And the attorneys will be like, so. So we're getting like this subconscious, like, yes, because of course they're going to say, yeah, we want you. You know, so naturally, I want to make sure that I can pay my bills, my legal bills. Obviously, you need to get paid. So now we've already subconsciously gotten two yeses. Yes, we agree. Yes, we agree. What's the ask? The ask could be, hey, can you help me dial in each month how much time I'm authorizing you to spend on my case so that it's not just carte blanche, like, oh, just, you know, open tab, right? So I've had clients say that to their attorneys. Like, hey, can I authorize X amount, which is X amount of hours per month.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we get toward the end of the month and we're bumping up against that, can you just let me know, like, hey, what are the priorities? Are there things that need to be done this month because they're time sensitive and urgent, or can we bump them to the next month? So we're not asking, like, hey, delay payment, which might be part of the ask too, like, hey, can we come up with a payment plan? Or whatever? What we're saying is I have anxiety around not knowing what my bill is going to be, and I want to be a responsible client, and I want to be able to pay you each month. So, can we come up with an agreement? And I haven't had any attorneys who have said no. Oh, there might be some out there that are like, I don't care.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want the open tab at the bar. You know, like, but I mean it. That seems reasonable as the ask. So those are the kinds of things that we're doing to just really empower people to show up and ask good questions and negotiate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's amazing how clear it seems when you say it like that. But in the moment where it's such an intimidating process, we're afraid of every 10-minute phone call we have with our lawyer. And I like how you framed it there of like, look, I have anxiety about the bill, I want you to get paid. And now the lawyer, they're probably grateful to have this. You're probably one of the first clients that have actually discussed it like that, like this, instead of waiting till it builds up. So yeah, I like how you really like strategically navigating these conversations. That alone sounds like it can save you time, money, anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's super helpful. And I think again, like, I always look at these strategies as, yes, this is great. And you can use them with the people that are part of your team. You can use them in the midst of negotiation. Even with your soon-to-be ex-spouse, you know, teeing up naturally. I want what's best for the kids. I know you do too. Here's the ask. And what are you asking them? Like what's important to you? What are you hoping to get their buy-in on? But at the end of the day, these are life skills. Like, I feel like these are things that are going to serve women well beyond the divorce process.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether they're going to be purchasing a home or buying a car, or you know, queuing up an email about being on a nonprofit board, I mean, who knows? But these are skills I have used and have been very helpful and have been well-received. So I love it that these types of things are things that we can empower our clients with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And I think it's interesting because you speak with so much clarity and calm because you have so much experience with this, and like you could be like a CEO of a company, and you had million-dollar negotiated deals. When it comes to like a divorce with somebody you've got a heated relationship with, that's not disclosing everything. I liked your acronym before your brain kind of just shorts out, and it's like, I know I'm an adult that can figure this out, but when it comes to this case, it's like I just turned to mush and I just wanted to go away. And I think that's where people don't realize that having like an advocate besides your divorce lawyer can be just so valuable. Have you seen that with a lot of, like high-profile clients that in their day-to-day life, they're crushing it. But when it comes to their divorce, they just fold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: For the women who are in positions of decision making and have had, you know, some level of success around career, I think the challenge there is recognizing that they need help. Because a lot of times they're like, hey, I, you know, I've handled some of this stuff, but then usually once they get into it, they realize like, yeah, this is man. Yes, I've got some of my stuff together on the financial side, but yes, I do still need somebody who can help be that thinking partner for me as I'm going through divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You shared one story earlier of somebody who went through it and didn't make the call, and it was like, ugh, I wish they would have talked to them. Do you have any other examples of clients who did speak out and it made a difference monetarily, or maybe another one? Sometimes we learn best from the mistakes of clients or potential people that you've seen that didn't speak out, and just where it caught up to them. And maybe we can learn from stories like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. So I would say that, you know, thankfully, the clients that end up working with me, we do give them the opportunity to speak up. I've told people, like, hey, if you don't want an advocate, if you don't want somebody who's going to stand in the gap for you, then I'm not your person. But there's a woman, as you're mentioning this, that comes to mind. She had reached out. She was from the Tennessee area. This was several years ago, and she was in the medical field. She decided to not work with me and decided to just kind of go on her own because she felt like, hey, I, I. And I'm kind of in the midst of it. I don't know how you can help me. And again, I'm not in the business of convincing people that they need me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, long story short, she moved forward without me, but we were still connected on your favorite platform, which is Instagram. And at the end of the day, she reached out probably about a year and a half after her divorce was finalized. And she said, Rhonda, I really wish that I would have listened to you, and I wish that I would have hired you. Because she ended up giving her the pension. Her husband, her ex-husband, kept his pension, and she got the marital home. And unfortunately, what was happening now is she got let go from her job. They were reorganizing or whatever, and so she was going to be foreclosing on her house, and she had no retirement and, you know, again, I can't save everybody, Rob, but I will die trying.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause those are the kinds of situations that I'm like, oh, my gosh, I would not have let her agree to that. You know, I mean, and it's tough because you're like, oh, you're giving, you know, advice, or are you empowering them? There's a combination of both. But sometimes, right, we get in our own way because we want to play nice, or we, you know, are figuring out, we'll figure it out later, or we only look at the short term, and we're not thinking about the long term. And, you know, at the end of the day, people do have to make their own choices. But I do think that having that level of detail and advocacy would have really helped her. And so those are the stories that I don't like hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can say that anybody that I'm working with on my watch, that stuff is not happening because we're advocating. You know what I mean? Like it's just.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It sounds like too. You're looking at something, maybe a divorce lawyer could say, well, you get the house, you get the pension. And they're like, on paper, maybe it looks like this is worth $200,000. This is worth $200,000. But somebody like you can come in and say, well, there's risk to this that you're not really seeing that. What if you can't keep the house, and then you're left with nothing? And maybe there's, like, more creative ways that you could cover yourself just in case. You see that a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I do. And, you know, there's tax consequences, and, you know, there's just a lot of pieces. And I think you brought up a good point, Rob, is I think, you know, as I'm looking at things, right, I'm not just like, hey, I'm crunching the numbers and here's a report. It's like, it is a dynamic thing. It's work. It's a. It's just as much an art as it is a science. Yes, we're going to crunch the numbers. And what's the strategy? What's the game plan? Where are the risks? Right. And what are the opportunities? And I think when women have that information, they can make really good decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It sounds like, too, what you're really helpful with is, like, their time crunch. And everything costs money in a divorce. That's got to be our biggest thing. It's taking forever, and everything costs money the longer it takes. So let's get it done, and you kind of can step in and say, I know it feels expensive to slow it down, and you just want to get this done. But like, by having somebody help you slow it down strategically, you might pay a little bit more upfront, but like, once those papers are signed, you could make. You could end up 10 times better than you did if you sign the papers just to get it over with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, absolutely. And I would say that the majority of my clients get at least a 10 times return on their investment of having me involved. That we've seen as much as like 100 or 300 times. And I'm like, I'm not putting that in any marketing materials because it just seems like, is that even really accurate? Like, we'll always go conservative on the numbers. We've helped more than 25 million. That's always growing. But we're gonna just go with conservative numbers because I feel better about that, and I think people can get their head around it. So it is important. I mean, it is important. Divorce is not free. And so you have to be very strategic on how you are investing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: But I think the key thing is working with people that have a proven track that you can, you know, pay them to be that thinking partner for you and they can give you that insight and direction and figure out, okay, what's the next best thing you can be doing and, you know, and giving them the framework, like my bridge method. I take people step by step through that process, and it's working. And so they're leaving empowered, they're leaving like they have a voice. They're realizing that they can speak up and they're seeing it move the needle. And so, you know, that's what this is all about. You know, for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Is there one more question? If somebody's listening right now, they are in the early stages or they're thinking about it. Is there some one thing you see that women really just don't realize about the long-term financial impact of their settlement that they're. They just can't really see now, but you can see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I think there's a couple things. I mean, kind of to the example we left earlier, talked about earlier, which is, you know, like, when you look at stuff at face value, like, oh, you keep this and I keep this, maybe that's good, maybe it isn't. We just got to do a little bit of a deeper dive. But there was a couple things that I was thinking of. The first one is property division is final. So you get one chance to get that right. So it can be a real problem. Like, oh, I wish I wouldn't have. Right. I also believe that there's a lot of times that women end up with buyers remorse. So they sign an agreement the next day. They're like, oh, should I have done that? I'm not really sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, like, when I'm in mediations with my clients and we're, you know, getting through that and I'm crunching the numbers and whatever, I will reach out to them the next day. I'm like, how are you feeling? And they're like, you know what? I feel really good. Because they know what they sign. Right. Which I think is part of it, too. Like, hey, not just get it done, you'll be fine. Right? It's what are you agreeing to, and what does this mean for you? And I always tell people, like, we can't just say, oh, you're going to be fine. We have to define what fine means for you. And when we do that's where women start to feel empowered. And I think that's ultimately the right thing..\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing that property division is final and that you, as the woman in this relationship, gets to define what fine is not. Oh, well, the judge says that, you know, you make more than, you know, he does in a year, so you should just be happy with what you're getting and move on. That attitude is not helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. And we see so many people like, ugh, I wish I saw it on our Instagram where they're running into problems two years later because their settlements were not clear. And if they wish I. They knew, and it really sounds like besides the financial benefit, the peace of mind that you're offering that you can live with for the rest of your life, that, like, I know I, you know, I stood up for myself. I know I got the best deal. Like, you really can't even a price on how valuable that is to somebody.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I think it's. It's really important. And I think those things that, you know, everything that we're making, recommendations, suggestions, insight for our clients, often to your point, Rob, is based on what problems have we seen if people are coming to us after the fact and they signed an agreement, you know, what are some of those areas that we're like, okay, we've seen this go sideways, you know, in people that didn't use our help. We're going to, okay, how can we do it better, you know, for the people that we're serving?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Rhonda, always a pleasure. Let people know how they can connect with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRhonda\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, my website is \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://womensfinancialwellnesscenter.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eWFWCDivorce.com\\u003c/a\\u003e. They can go to the resources tab, all kinds of freebies. There, they can connect to my podcast, blog, my book, all the things. So \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://womensfinancialwellnesscenter.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eWFWCDivorce.com\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\r\\n\\r\\nRob: Thank you, Rhonda. This is always a pleasure. Be sure to check out Rhonda's material. I love it. A lot of free stuff she's giving out. And your \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.instagram.com/rhondanoordyk/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eInstagram\\u003c/a\\u003e is one of my favorites because you're telling real stories that you know, you're seeing with clients and that's really the best way for people to learn is, you know, you've got to walk, you know, don't take advice from somebody that hasn't walked in your shoes. And divorce is just filled with bad advice, even from well-meaning people. So I think it's so important to find the right people to guide you because it is like, you know, once your divorce papers are signed, in a lot of ways, you're just starting out this journey, so do it right.

I am your host, Rob Roseman. Today, we are lucky to be joined by Simon Ragona from the NGH Group. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://thenghgroup.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eNGH Group\\u003c/a\\u003e is a digital forensics expert who helps uncover deleted texts, hidden spyware, and digital threats, especially.

Simon, thanks for being here today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Thanks for having me. Looking forward to the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, just, we were just talking before we started recording how it feels like we're in like the early to late 90s Internet days. It's crazy how much, how fast things are changing today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, technology's moving. We've got AI, we've got different types of machine learning, cryptocurrency. It's all getting very interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yes, and divorces are not going away. So it's interesting to see how these two industries, problems, everything are gonna mesh. And I think it's really important stuff we're gonna share here today for people that are listening and going through it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: For sure, we've got some good stuff to talk about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: All right, well, let's hop right in. We got a bunch of questions. So let's go with the first question here. What is the biggest mistake people are making when they're going through a divorce? In regards to their tech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, yeah, obviously in regards to tech. So, you know, the biggest mistake that I see is, you know, a lot of people just kind of get caught up in the divorce itself. A lot of times there's kids involved, obviously, there's finances, there's properties, and a lot of people forget about their technology. And depending on how long people were married or together, there could be a lot of overlap there. A lot of shared accounts, a lot of shared devices, and oftentimes, people will forget about that, especially in the early stages of divorce. Emotions are running hot. There's a lot of things going on, and eventually you've got to separate those, you know, from those accounts and from that technology. But a lot of people forget that. So that's generally the biggest mistake I see is they just, you know, that kind of hits the back burner as they're going through things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What might that look like? Because even yesterday we have the Apple shared account with my ex and the kids, and I want to download this. You got all these emotions, all this tech overwhelm is a lot for us on a. On A regular basis. Now we throw divorce into it. Is there, when you say shared accounts, what would be like a one-action step somebody could do today to help mitigate some of this risk?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you came out with something that I see very often, and it's the Apple shared accounts, Apple shared devices. And I will say Apple has gotten a lot better over the years as far as providing that Apple family sharing and people will have different Apple accounts or, as we know them, Apple IDs. But sometimes, and I still see it today, where it's a single Apple ID that was used to set up a primary device, possibly you get a new iPad. Now your Apple ID is on that old iPad that might be sitting around the house. And a lot of times, what's happening is data is getting synced, whether it's text messages or different application data. So that's one example of a shared account. But it can go a little bit deeper there.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the Internet that's coming into the house, you could even have your cell phone plans. Literally any sort of cloud account that somebody set up for could have been shared, where it's one single ID that's used for both. But that's where I see a lot of overlap and sharing. And then again as you introduce kids into the situation now you've got kids accounts and kids devices, which those can, for better or worse, those can ultimately, you know, be used as surveillance devices and whatnot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, and that's a great point. What can people do to protect their kids' devices and data during a custody dispute? Is that something you want to jump right into? Take their device and disconnect it, or what would you advise somebody when they're in the midst of this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, kids' devices can be a challenge. You know, whether you're going through divorce or not, parental controls and what kids can or cannot have. You know, really, when it comes to divorce, though, it's making sure that the kids' devices don't have your login information. So the mother or the father doesn't have your email account or your iCloud account logged into it. Because again that child device is probably going to be going back and forth, especially if there's physical separation at some point. So it's really making sure that the kids are ultimately set up with their own accounts and not using the parents' accounts, but going back to the parents' accounts and any sort of shared accounts. One of the first things that needs to be done is to separate yourself from any accounts that you might have shared or any devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you have to go out and get a new device or sign up for a new account, it can kind of be a little bit of a pain. But at the end, it's going to be worthwhile to make sure none of your data is flowing into somebody else's hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I hear that a lot. Whether that might look like, as a really basic first step, setting up a new email just for you, or maybe a new Apple ID just to like starting now on my phone, I know I'm logged into this when I'm doing a lot of this communication that I might not want my partner to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's right, that's right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Again, it may be a little bit of a pain, especially if you're truly sharing an account. If you have a single email account, you know, you don't really see that. But a lot of times, it's those devices that may just have somebody else's login information stored on it, or it's set up to receive that information. But you really want to go through and do a complete audit and inventory of what you have. It truly needs to be added to that checklist of when you're going through a divorce. Whether it's early stages, thinking about divorce, or you're in the middle of a divorce, or even after, there's no wrong time to do it, the only wrong move that can be made is not doing it at all. And again, that's where there could be information going out the door into the wrong hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a lot of times, I see these divorces getting very nasty, very ugly, and one party or another may be really looking to get a leg up in the divorce and trying to get information. And the number one step from a technology standpoint to protect yourself is to make sure you separate your devices and separate your accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. And you said it here. For anybody listening, we all know firsthand of how big of a pain in the ass is. I get an Apple request from my kids, and I gotta log out and log in and just. It's like that friction alone that they create is enough to be like, I don't even want to deal with this. And maybe you can get away with that. You know, when you're married and things are going well, but when you're in the midst of a divorce, it's like you almost have to prioritize these annoying tasks that you would much rather just kick to the curb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's right. And depending on your typical behavior going into it, and what I mean by that is it's kind of your cyber hygiene. You know, are you the type of person that uses the same password for everything, the same PIN code for everything? You're writing your passwords down on notes, or even saving them in a contact card or your notes application on your phone, which I discourage because that information, as we say in the tech space, that's clear text, that basically means it's not encrypted, somebody could gain access to it. As opposed to encrypted credentials, encrypted data where you're storing that using a password manager, you know, like Apple Keychain, a lot of people would be familiar with there. But yeah, though, it depends on what the hygiene is going into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a lot of times, you know, in the best case scenario, is where I see people understanding that I need to clean up my own behavior in regards to my passwords. This is an opportunity for me to reset all my passwords, start storing them in a password manager. And you know, sometimes I describe it as, listen, this is a little bit of a rainy day activity. When you're in bed, a lot of people are just scrolling through their phone, looking at social media, looking at other things. You can start chipping away at it. Then, you know, you hit two or three accounts, change the passwords. You know, it's going to take 10, 15 minutes. But, you know, once you start doing it becomes easy and comfortable. But the last thing you want to do is say, you know what? I forgot to do it. And that's how they got this information. So you don't want to kick yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's a great point of like breaking it down into an actionable thing where it's like, for 30 minutes today, I'm going to set up the password manager that I probably knew I should have done. But now it's almost. In a lot of ways, divorce is like a rebirth. And you're gonna start going to the gym, and I'm gonna be eating better. I'm gonna do all these new things. And one of them, something we don't like to think about, is like, I gotta get more organized. And in reality that might be cleaning your house, but your computer and your devices, this is like a forced, it's an opportunity to do so, but it's, it is a, an urgent thing that you really, you need to prioritize and you need to break it into like an actionable thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause I think all of us are like, this is too much. And now I'm scrolling TikTok and seeing my ex post or something like that. So, yeah, empathy to anybody out there, this is an overwhelming thing, but just so important today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. And one more point I'll mention is that, you know, sometimes it's one party, you know, whether it's the husband, it usually is the husband that may have been the one to set up all the tech, you know, the one that's more tech savvy, that set up the router in the house and owns the Internet plan, owns the cell phone plan, helps set up your email accounts. Those are the things and those are the situations that I would say are most critical, you know, and people that find themselves in the situation of, well, I never set any of this up. I don't know anything about it. You know, I'm a tech dinosaur. You really have to go out, find a friend, find a relative, find somebody that knows how to do that stuff that can help out with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause you know, those situations where one party set up all the tech and the other one's clueless to it are a lot of times where there's, you know, what I would call maybe a back door where there's a recovery account set up in that other person's name or you know, there may be other devices linked to those accounts that you have set up and that's where you'll see that information bleeding out to somebody else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's a great point as to like find in the whole divorce process, it's like finding help more than just your divorce lawyer. And that could be the tech-savvy friend that you can trust because doing it all on your own is going to be overwhelming. And you know, we'll talk about what The NGH Group does and how they can help you. But yeah, I imagine like this is a service that everybody's like, please just, just do it for me. So make the ask to a friend and you'd be surprised. A lot of people are happy to help you, but you do have to ask them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's right. That's right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: How about during the process if you suspect that your ex is still accessing your email or your social media, what would you advise somebody could do?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So the very first step, because this could be something where you get an email notification or a pop-up notification on a device, and you have that gut feeling that somebody, and maybe you have that gut feeling that it's your ex, regardless, immediately change Passwords to those particular accounts. And you want to start with the accounts that are most critical. Those are going to be the ones that hold communications, especially if you're having communications with your attorneys. And those privileged communications, likely in your email account, immediately change the password. If you're using an Apple or Google device, you want to make sure you change those accounts right away, right off the bat. And then the next ones, any more consequential accounts down the line might be your financial accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then especially, I talked about cyber hygiene and typical behavior if you use the same password across all of your accounts or a variation of it. Unfortunately, it's more accounts that you're now going to have to go through and change passwords for. But if you suspect something, the immediate first step is to change your passwords and then implement two-factor authentication, also known as multi-factor authentication or two-step verification. And a lot of people are probably aware of what that is nowadays. But that's where you're going to get a PIN code texted to your phone or an authenticator app is set up, where you'll get, where you enter a particular code to verify your authentication to that account. That's critical. Those are gonna be the first two steps to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the third item is really gonna be refrain from making any changes as far as you don't wanna delete an account or disable an account, suspend an account, try to go about, quote unquote, investigating it yourself. And this is where we at the NGH Group typically step into a project or an investigation is when somebody suspects there was foul play in their accounts and an unauthorized user, they think it was their ex. Maybe they have evidence to show, yeah, I saw his or her iPhone pop up and requested authentication or yeah, authentication to the account. But you want to refrain from making any of those changes because that from our standpoint can hinder an investigation of critical evidence that will ultimately prove that somebody was doing something nefarious to those accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Don't go doing that yourself, it sounds like. Also, maybe don't go immediately accusing your ex of why are you getting in my email? Like maybe keep your cards kind of close to the vest and talk to a professional and document all this stuff instead of just firing it off and you know, getting into it with your ex soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's a key and very valid point there. Don't go assuming that it's your ex in this situation. It could be something completely inadvertent, I mean, there's a lot of hackers out there that are trying to get into many different types of accounts. So, you know, don't go immediately accusing them, even if you have evidence. You know, a lot of times that initial piece that we'll see is a particular notification of a device that may have the ex's name on it. And it's very apparent that it is them. This is where you want to talk to your lawyer right away. Document it. Take screenshots if you have to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, because those early stages, you know, let's just say your ex connected to your account and you got a pop-up notification of their device and you see some information in the account related to that, immediately take a couple of screenshots, whatever you have to document it. Because after you talk to your lawyer, possibly engage a forensics firm like The NGH Group, we want to take that evidence and utilize that for the investigation to figure out, all right, what was the timestamp that this device connected? What was the account name? What was the device name? There's a lot of key factors there that'll really help kind of unfold what ultimately happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again, even if it wasn't your ex and you just noticed some suspicious notification, some suspicious account or device that connected to you somehow, some way, you know, even if it's not your ex, you just want to document that to be sure and then don't go making changes. You know, there are times where I'll see a client unfortunately, says, yeah, I deleted the account because I got nervous and afraid. Well, sometimes, depending on the type of service, type of account, type of device, when you go about deleting information, it may not be recoverable, especially if too much time passes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it is helpful because our initial response is always, you know, when you feel like you're getting hacked or somebody's invading your privacy, you want to protect yourself or fire back. And you know, especially in a divorce, we see that even, you know, agitating the other person unnecessarily if they didn't do something can really derail your case. Could lead to a way longer and more expensive case. We always tell people, pause before you respond. Take some time and think it through strategically. Because in a lot of ways, like getting to the end of your divorce is, you know, that's the goal, doing it peacefully, saving time. And there's a lot of ways to screw that up that are our responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Let's talk about, can somebody legally install spyware or tracking apps on a spouse's phone?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So I'm not a lawyer, but I will say it's not legal to go about installing spyware or trackers on. On your spouse's phone, whether you're in the early stages or even, you know, not even in divorce. But you just, you know, thinking, oh, I want to see where they're going. It's not legal to do that. You know, obviously, if you need to consult with your lawyer on what it is you might want to do. The other thing that you really want to avoid is if you have access to your spouse's account or your ex's account, because they haven't changed their password or they haven't changed something, you need to remove yourself. You know, don't go about poking through and accessing their account because that. That is not legal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you don't want to get caught up in a situation where now you're obtaining information by accessing their account without authorization. Even if at some point earlier, you were the one to set it up and you set it up on a device and it's still syncing to your account. If you're aware of that, remove yourself. From a forensic standpoint, there's typically artifacts to prove that you accessed it. So you can't play the card of, well, I didn't actually know, because we can pull logs whether it's from the device or the account, or oftentimes there's, you know, situations where we're assisting an attorney with drafting a subpoena to that particular service provider to request additional logs and information that can ultimately prove what you've done and when somebody's accessed an account, how they've accessed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you want to avoid doing that as well as just the possibility of installing spyware or trackers. And I will say, on the spyware side, you could probably Google all day long and look for a device to track my spouse, track my ex, or spyware for an iPhone. You'll come across all sorts of pieces of software. They're generally inexpensive, but a lot of cases, you know, they claim to do things that they ultimately don't. But again, from a forensic standpoint, all of that leaves traces, even your preliminary Internet searches of just Googling for how to do that or different types of things. Right from the start of you thinking about it, you know, we can trace that information back. So you really want to avoid it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf those thoughts come across your mind, or if you have a friend that went through a prior divorce that said they did it and how helpful it was. Avoid it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So me going to an incognito browser and typing where to bury my husband is not a good idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's not a good idea. There's lots of spots where that information is still going to be recoverable and traced, especially Internet searches, Internet history, like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Resist. The diary is sitting right there. Resist the urge to open it. Even if you have the key, you don't want to even know what's in there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: How about like deleted messages? People are texting things, deleting them. Are those gone forever when you sent, when that happens?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So this is. This has become a much trickier situation than it used to be, especially text messages. Those seem to be the number one piece that people want to uncover, want to recover if they were deleted. And truthfully, it has become more difficult to recover text messages just due to simply hardware changes as well as software changes, and how these databases that hold messages actually operate. So not. I won't get into the kind of technical nuance of why that is, but ultimately, it is more difficult to recover text messages. But we do a lot of times recover deleted information as well as just from other different types of devices. So even if it was deleted from an iPhone and it's not recoverable from an iPhone, there may still be a backup of that iPhone out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere may be an iPad that hasn't recently synced. There could be an old iTunes backup from when it was connected to a computer. So there's lots of different data sources to uncover that information, even if it's not there available directly from the device itself. But in terms of deleted messages, this may be a situation where again, going back to your typical cyber hygiene and behavior, if you're the type of person that just routinely deletes text messages, whether you don't want that history on your phone or you believe it saves room and storage space on your device, if you're going through a divorce and you're getting messages, you know, accusatory messages or just, you know, negative messages, whatever they might be, probably a good idea just not to delete them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again, if you need to retain that information, you know, I will say screenshots are an okay way of doing that. You know, I'll get into and talk about why that may not be an advisable way. But, you know, bringing in a forensics firm like The NGH Group to create a forensic image of an account or of a device to ensure that information is retained in a forensic process, full chain of custody, fully defensible. That's the best way to do it. You know, there are other ways, but ultimately it comes back to, you know, if there is critical information that you believe would be beneficial to your case, avoid deleting it. Because yes, it can be more difficult to recover, and at the same time, a much more costly endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there was something critical, a picture, a message, an email that you did delete, and now you really need it, that may involve, from a forensic standpoint, collecting a lot of data from a lot of devices and then doing a very comprehensive type of analysis to ultimately recover it. So it could be a costly endeavor as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Good to know we're seeing AI is just like everywhere now. If you're seeing any dangerous things to watch out for with AI, whether that's spoofing messages or even voices or people, any couple examples that you're seeing in the, that people should watch out for in the divorce world with AI, yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Big time AI has really started to pop. We've been talking about it for years. In fact, in a lot of our presentations and classes, and different sorts of seminars, we've been talking about AI and machine learning and how it can be used. And we will show examples of how you can simply use it with very inexpensive or free tools with limited knowledge. You know, simply going out and doing a couple of searches, looking on YouTube, you can educate yourself pretty quickly to create something and manipulate something that looks real.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we're now, we are seeing it in cases where evidence is being put presented as though it's something from the other side, whether it's an audio recording, a screenshot, you know, I mentioned earlier screenshots from a device where that information has ultimately been created using some sort of AI tool to create what might be referred to as a deep fake. So we're seeing it quite a bit. We've got current active cases going on where we're assisting clients and in authenticating different types of evidence. And I talk about pulling logs. There's ways that we can prove it beyond just the metadata of a file. So the metadata is that underlying information related to a file, the creation timestamps, possibly the device that was used, or the software that was used to create that, we pull that from those particular files that are suspected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we can get our hands on devices, whether it's an iPhone that may have, you know, been an app to use to do it, or a computer. And I mentioned earlier, Google searches and internet searches. This all traces back to the start of when somebody thought about doing IT and wanted to figure out how to do it. And so it's very difficult to cover up one's tracks when they do that. But, you know, we are seeing a lot of AI-generated material being introduced into litigation and during divorces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's got to be. It's got to be exciting for you guys getting to see all this new technology and come into play and figure out ways to. To mitigate it, because people are. It does seem like the wild west right now, where we're just scratching the surface of, like, the power of all this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it's. It's. It's exciting, it's concerning, it's challenging. There's a lot of factors that play into it. And, you know, not to get into the. The regulation around AI, or the lack thereof, but there's just lots of different tools, lots of software out there. You know, for less than 20 bucks a month, somebody can subscribe to an AI platform. You hear ChatGPT is, you know, a common one that people talk about. But those tools can be used to generate this type of material, and they can be really good at it, especially depending on, you know, how you train those models, you know, because they basically take existing information. So, whether it's voicemails from a spouse or an ex, or video clips that you have of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, you know, nowadays, you know, the last 10 years, the amount of videos and pictures and audio files that somebody might have on their phone that can all be fed into one of these engines to basically train and learn and now be able to create that person's voice. Voice or possibly even a video file. So, yeah, it's exciting. It's very concerning. And again, we as forensic experts are identifying ways to uncover it, validate it, verify the integrity of a piece of data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It's really a lot easier for somebody to probably make them. I was the perfect husband. Listen to me here. Look at all of these emails, all these messages, when in reality, none of it is real. And somebody is probably losing their mind saying, this is not who this person is. Something is going on and they might not even know that they have these kind of capabilities today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's right. And lawyers that are involved, you know, when you're listening to your clients and they're saying, this was absolutely 100% not me. I never said that. You know, I never did that. I never sent that. Yeah, you've got to take a step back and. And possibly, you know, look into that further. You mentioned emails. I touched on screenshots earlier, there's tools out there that, within five minutes, you can create a fake text message screenshot. You know, whether you want to plug in Verizon or AT\\u0026amp;T, you can adjust the battery level. You could do green bubbles, blue bubbles, and type whatever message you want, and hand that in as a piece of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again, when an iMessage is sent or a text message is sent, that's going through some service provider, whether it's Verizon, for example, or whether it's an iMessage going through Apple, there's some sort of record of that. So that's how we go about authenticating those different pieces of evidence that may have been submitted that are not real. And same with emails as well. It's very easy if you even just pull up an email and click the forward button on it. Now you can go down into the body of it into an existing thread and maybe change something, add a sentence, you know, drop something in there, and now present that as what you are perceiving was like this real email. Well, again, there's ways to trace that back, and that's where we come into play as far as authenticating that data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So you gotta have your radar up more now today than ever. Be more skeptical, and yeah, talk to a professional is something that, you know, we'll let people know at the end of this how to contact you guys. One more topic that we're starting to hear a lot more about, especially when it comes to divorce and finances. What are you seeing with crypto and bitcoin, or people secretly hiding this where the spouse doesn't even know? Oh, they put, you know, a thousand dollars into this. Now they have 10 million. I never even knew about it. What kind of things are you seeing with crypto and divorce today?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, crypto, you know, kind of like AI has been booming here. Crypto over the past few years has been another area where, you know, again, typically we're seeing, you know, it's not both parties involved in a divorce. And I hate to be pointing out the males, but a lot of times, you know, it is, it's the husband that may have, you know, dabbled in crypto, gotten involved with, you know, bitcoin mining, and the other party just has no idea. And you know, what we've seen is those assets being hidden, being moved around, being moved into different wallets or, you know, possibly being cashed out, but lots of different ways that people are trying to obfuscate where that money is, you know, and the old saying of follow the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, that's what we do from a crypto investigation standpoint, where we do blockchain investigations, bitcoin investigations, and identify, you know, where there might be hidden assets. You know, it's something that we could probably talk on for a couple hours as far as, you know, different types of things we've seen and you know, how we go about investigating it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, because I think there's a misconception, there is a lot of privacy with that, but at the same time, it can be quite traceable. So like if you suspect this kind of thing, it is important to talk to a professional because you know, there could be a hidden treasure there that you might be, you know, due part of because you were married that you're missing out on just because it's confusing and seems above your pay grade but worth. Worth digging into.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's exactly right. You know, during that financial disclosure, you know, number one, if you're thinking I can hide this, you know, through some sort of cryptocurrency because, you know, my spouse doesn't even know that I do this or have this. Yeah, there is a misconception that it's private and anonymous, a big misconception because it's very much traceable right back to, you know, where it originated, the movement of that. And you know, we have certified experts in-house that we utilize to, you know, trace those assets and uncover and identify where there may be additional assets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, that's tons of great advice on here. I'm sure everybody listening, if they're going through it, is completely overwhelmed, and they're thinking, I can't handle this all myself. When should somebody bring in a digital forensics group like The NGA group, like what is a good time or indicator where it's time to reach out?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: To somebody, you know, from the early stages, as soon as you suspect something. And a lot of times it may just be that gut feeling, you know, somebody may know a few more things than they should, or you're positive you only had this conversation with one person when you were driving in your car and there's absolutely no way that your spouse or your ex should know about that. And you know, there's just little clues that have now tipped you off. And like I said, a lot of times it's just that gut feeling that you have. But again, earlier we were talking about notifications that you might get, whether it's an email notification or a pop-up Those initial instances are where you want to talk to an expert. You know, like us at The NGH Group. We have tons of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been doing this for 20 years. We do a lot in the family law, matrimonial space, and we see a lot of different things. But in those early stages, you know, where you just feel something's off, something's going on, even if it's just those early stages of, you know what, I'm not sure if something's going on, but I want to be certain. I just want that peace of mind. I want somebody to review my accounts, review my devices, just make sure that, you know, no one is connected, there isn't some sort of rogue device in there, especially for those that just aren't that familiar with it or somebody else set up those accounts, set up those devices, you know, even if it gets into.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I know we've talked more so on kind of like the cyber aspect of accounts and devices, you know, but even tracking devices, recording devices that may have been planted in a vehicle or a house, those what we refer to as TSCM or Technical Surveillance countermeasure sweeps, where we actually bring in equipment to physically look for those types of devices, because it's not uncommon that, you know, a GPS tracking device is thrown on the bottom of a car with, you know, a magnet or possibly even just a recording device, you can go out to Amazon and probably, you know, find about 100 of them for less than 50 bucks. You know, those types of things we will also look for. And then eventually, those have a digital footprint themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut any sort of early-stage activity where you're feeling uncomfortable, suspicious, you know, just want to be proactive, you know, that's when you want to reach out and make sure that you're covering your tech. I'll circle this back to the first thing I said, which is that first mistake, or oftentimes the miss. The biggest mistake that I see is just forgetting about the tech side of it, the cyber side of it. You know, it's such an important piece that needs to be addressed early.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, it really is. Prioritizing it. When you're saying all that, I'm picturing like a Breaking Bad episode. And your husband doesn't have to be Walter White for there to be some shenanigans going on. But like you said, I think you bring it back to the peace of mind. And even if it is a bit of an investment up front, like, you cannot value how much knowing that, like, you have some control over what's going on? You have a team behind you, so speak to your lawyer about connecting with an expert. Let people know how they can connect with The NGH Group, Simon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So The NGH Group, simply it’s TheNGHGroup.com. Our main office and forensics lab is located in Long Island. I actually run our Buffalo, New York office. So, you know, we do a lot on the East Coast, but, you know, we work nationally, internationally, you know, especially. We're just talking about the crypto cases. We're doing a ton of stuff. Crypto all over the place. And because it's tech and it's cyber, it's not just, you know, in the big cities anymore. You know, I started my career in New York, but this is widespread. Everywhere but TheNGHGroup.com, and that's where you can talk with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, whether it's pre-divorce, thinking about it, middle of a divorce, or post, you know, anytime you start to think about tech or something going on, want to investigate it, want to be proactive, that's when you should really be reaching out to an expert.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Awesome, Simon.

She emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, clear and specific communication, and utilizing tools like relationship audits to gain a deeper understanding of a marriage's current state. Together, Rob and Cindy explore why it’s crucial to address concerns early, how to approach conversations with empathy rather than blame, and why staying in a marriage where you’re no longer emotionally present can be unfair to both partners.\\r\\n\\u003cdiv style=\\u0022padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003ciframe style=\\u0022position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\u0022 title=\\u0022DivorceLawyer.com Podcast #7 - Cindy Stibbard, Certified Relationship \\u0026amp; Divorce Coach - The End of Love: Beginning of Divorce?\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/video/1095013568?h=a0a8e46f07\\u0026amp;badge=0\\u0026amp;autopause=0\\u0026amp;player_id=0\\u0026amp;app_id=58479\\u0022 frameborder=\\u00220\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cscript src=\\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/script\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eHIGHLIGHTS\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMany people feel stuck, unsure if disconnection means divorce.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSocial media helps normalize self-reflection about relationships.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eDivorce decisions today are based on clarity, not haste.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eVague statements like “I’m not happy” confuse partners.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eUse “I” statements and share personal feelings.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eRelationship audits offer clear insight into strengths and areas for improvement.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAddress issues early before disconnection deepens.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eCoaching helps individuals recognize patterns and understand their needs.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eCouples therapy can feel intimidating or defensive.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eStaying disconnected denies both partners real connection.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSlow down and seek clarity before making a decision.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSupport tools can guide thoughtful decisions.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eTRANSCRIPT\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Welcome to the DivorceLawyer.com Podcast. I am your host, Rob Roseman. Today, we are lucky to be joined by Cindy Stibbard. Cindy is a divorce and relationship coach, and she really gets deep into the questions: Am I ready for a divorce? Is this the next step? That is the feeling that just really bogs most people down. Cindy, thank you for being here today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, thanks, Rob. Good to be back. Excited to talk about, you know, all things that we talk about on this. This great podcast about relationships and divorce and, you know, all the things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I mean, it's so interesting because, like, when we're out of divorce, which both of us are, there's a lot more of a clarity and like, oh, we know what we're thinking. But, like, when you're in it, you're in such a fog because you have no context of, like, is this normal? We're not sleeping together that often anymore. Or, like, we're fighting more, but, like, is that part of a marriage, or is this a divorce? Have we fallen out of love? Is that a question you hear a lot from clients?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Oh, my gosh, I hear it all the time. I think a lot of people come to me with the spark being gone, and then they're afraid. Is that enough for this marriage to just end? You know, I think a lot of people get to that place where they are almost on autopilot in their marriage. You know, they just kind of keep going because they've got kids and they've built this life and. And it's just like Groundhog Day after day after day. And they think, wow, is this. Is this really as good as it gets? And they look. They realize one day, look at their partner and feel, I don't even feel love anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, I mean, you might love them as the person that they are and the parent that they are and all those things, but then it comes down to, like, am I actually still in love? And that can be. That can be a really hard question to answer because. Or to even face because there are lots of times when we look at our relationships or marriages, think, well, nothing bad is really happening. Like, you know, I'm not getting beaten or something. There's no abuse. There's nothing that's really standing out as, like, the. The key factor for why this relationship shouldn't work. It's just that I don't feel it anymore. I get that a lot from people coming to me so stuck in that I don't even know how I feel anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I know. I wonder, like, it seems like this generation with social media and a lot more education and awareness. I remember like an older generation would be like, well, that's what marriage is. It's not supposed to be fun, it's supposed to be hard. Do you think people are maybe like quicker to pull the trigger now and say, well, I'm not feeling this anymore, let's get divorced. Or, or are you seeing like there's still a lot of nuance in like how those decisions actually get made?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, I think there's still tons of nuance, and I don't think that people are pulling the trigger and getting divorced easier than they were before. I just think that now they're giving themselves more permission to really dig into it and understand it more. And those people who aren't happy, okay, what can I do to be happier? What can I do to be happy either in this relationship or maybe get, give myself permission to finally look at that this isn't the right relationship for me. And I think that's the, that's what to me, what social media has brought is that this sense of permission that you're not, there's nothing wrong with you, that you're not flawed, that you're not crazy, that you might be feeling this way, you know, and the outcome of it could be different for everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the nice part is that you don't have to be doing this alone. I feel like when I was at that stage, all of the social media platforms like we have now about relationships didn't exist. So I felt like I was a crazy one just sitting there wondering like, what is happening to me and why do I feel this way, and what do I do about it. I wish that there was more education and understanding back then. I mean, that was eight years ago. Now that there is now because it could have probably processed it a little bit better. I probably, you know, would have done more learning and self-work and understanding what I was going through rather than just be struggling so much on my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, and it seems like I think one of the hardest parts too is like, okay, I'm learning this stuff now I have to communicate it with my partner who we're not getting along with, who might not be watching the same videos, might be defensive, might feel and like that's where a lot of it can go awry. It's like I'm coming from a good place. I'd like to see if this can work. But our communication just falls apart after, you know, one effort, and then I'm like, throw my hands up in the air. Do you see that a lot? And is that what you work with clients a lot on is, like, how to have these conversations?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yes. Oh, my gosh. All the time. How do you actually communicate your needs and what you're feeling to your partner? And I often encourage them to look at it as almost like a data collection experience. Right. Like, once I know what my needs are and I really want to communicate and have the hard conversation. And we do it now, let's see where it lands. Because how they carry it, how they have space for it, how they understand it and interpret it, and how they respond or react to you is also going to give you a lot of information of, can I even continue to build with this person once I've told them my needs and, you know, shared this with them and being very vulnerable and, you know, done a lot of work? Can.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre they the person that, you know, you can share that with? Can the changes be made? Are they open to that? Or are you met with a wall of resistance and defensiveness? And maybe they shut down? And maybe this just gives you more answers in terms of why I feel this way, and then what this might mean for me if I'm trying to create a relationship that might not be possible with the person that I'm with, because I'm trying to do new things. I'm trying to get, you know, get deeper, communicate, and they're just not receiving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I'm putting you on the spot here with, like, what are the words you can say? But I imagine a lot of. We hear a lot, you know, especially on Instagram. I was telling him for years, and he never listened. And maybe that is true in somebody's mind, but maybe they weren't communicating it in a way. Or maybe they were like, read my mind. You can tell I'm unhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Are there maybe one or two, like, scripts or tips for how to breach that conversation and maybe even to like, lower your expectations of, like, the first time I say this, they're probably going to be defensive and say, I am trying, and maybe don't, like, throw in the towel based on that. How do you approach a conversation like that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, and I think you're right. I think a lot of times we think that we've said it and we've been really clear about it, but we haven't really been. Or we assume that they know how we feel because we're checked out, or we're not engaging, or we're not saying the things, or we're not saying, I love you. Or we're not sleeping with our partner, but it's not the, you know, the things that you aren't doing. You need to actually be really clear. And I think the clearer that you are and the more specific that you are, the better it lands. And I think a lot of times, too, we tend to place blame when we're at that place of frustration and we're feeling defeated and we're just kind of done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe tend to then go on almost the attack mode of here's what you are doing to make me unhappy, and this is why. And a lot of times, I mean, we know how that feels. If we're on the attack mode, we shut down and we don't really hear it. So, to soften it is to talk about how you're feeling. Like, I'm not happy in this relationship because this is what's not working for me, not what you're doing wrong. You know, or I feel this way when we talk this way, or when I feel that maybe I'm not being listened to. You know, I think it's all about the approach and making it about softening the approach, sharing with your partner why you're not happy in terms of your experience and not necessarily what they're doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, it will come, it'll come around to talking about what that behavior is that makes you unhappy. But to start it out, it has to be in this soft, non-attacky kind of way so that they can at least open up to listen to it. And you have to be clear, you have to be specific. You just can't say, well, I'm not happy. Because what does that mean? What are you not happy about? Like, look at this life, and you hear this all the time. Like a lot of men will be. What do you mean? Let's look at this life I provide for you. You get to do this, you get to have this, you get to do this. But what can you not be happy about?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So it's so important to be very specific about what it is that you're not happy about and share that from your own perspective. Using I statements is kind of, you know, the thing cliche in a way, but it's very true in terms of how you present how you feel from your perspective and not it's because you are doing this to me. Does that make sense?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Oh, and I imagine a lot of times we're like, we don't even know why we're unhappy. So it's like we've got to do the homework first to be like, I'm not happy in this relationship, but why? Maybe I need to write down it's this instance or that, and like slowing it down. Also realizing that, like, this is my first seed that I'm planting. So don't expect like me to fix my marriage after I have this one brave conversation that my husband or wife didn't even know was coming. Totally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So, yeah, I imagine a lot of it is just like slowing it down. Patience and not waiting until, like, is it too far gone? A lot of times when people have these conversations, like, do you think it's. A lot of times, it's just hopeless by the time you actually have this, it's too far gone. Or have you seen a chance to reconcile?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You know, I, I do see a bit of both. I see that some people who hold it in so long and they aren't able to be specific, and they don't really know what their underlying needs are. They can be too far gone. You know, I see a lot of times people who aren't very clear with what they need, and they just say, I'm unhappy. And then, you know, the partner doesn't know what to do. And then you finally get to be more and more specific, and your partner finally starts to do the work. It's almost like you've left it so long now, you don't even care about them changing and doing the work because you don't even want that version of them anyways. But I, you know, it's a two-way street.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen your partner is telling you that they're not happy about something, then we need to listen. What is it that you're not happy about? Because if we start to ignore that, then obviously it's just going to grow and it's going to fester and it's going to turn into something bigger than what it could have been at the time that you would have addressed it. And no one likes to address issues in their relationship. And a lot of times, like you had just said, sometimes we don't know exactly what that means, that we're not happy. And so we tend to then look at the actions like, well, it's because you don't help me around the house or, you know, you don't help me with the kids. But that's not actually the reason. It's because you feel like you don't have a partner in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou feel alone doing all of these, you know, tasks at home. You feel like it's a heavy load to lift on your own. You want to feel connected, that someone has your back, that someone's in this with you, that they respect everything that you're doing. It goes deeper. And so that's why I always like to encourage people when they're in that place of they don't know or work with someone, work with a coach, with a therapist, to really get clear on what is it specifically that you're not happy about. Because it's not about the dishes, right? It's not about that. It goes a bit deeper. And. And when you can understand what's underlying it, then you can more clearly communicate that to your partner. But do it as they start, you know, as they start coming up in your relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't leave it forever, because you'll sweep all these things under the rug or you'll try to shove them down, and then they'll just come out and explode. It's like a tsunami of all of these issues that you've been holding in for years, and you just can't repair that way when there's just too many. So it's so important to just work on them as they come up. And partners have to listen. You know, if your partner is saying to you, I'm not happy, you gotta start listening, or right when they say it, and try to figure out what you guys can do to get it back on track. Don't, like, don't let it fester. Don't wait.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And as you know, and I found out with our big Instagram, a lot of our audience is women that are doing a lot of this work and thought, you know, maybe years before it gets to the divorce, maybe they're not communicating it, and maybe guys are not, you know, aware of it. So it's like, you do have to, like, if you're going to try and make this work, you do have to, like, kind of say, let's try this as partners. Even if it doesn't work out, at least we've, like, really given it a shot. And one thing that I've. I've learned it's kind of a trick that I'm sure you've heard of. Chris Voss, the hostage negotiator.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's like the first sentence that you say to somebody, especially in, like, a very stressful conversation like this, like, I know you're saying that I feel is very important, but even, like, framing it as, like, I know this is going to be an uncomfortable conversation to have. I know you feel like, I'm always criticizing you and empathizing with your partner instead of just like, I don't have this. This, this. It might be received a lot better because your partner might be having a lot of these feelings too. But, like, they just always feel like they're being attacked. So a lot of it really is. I mean, that's why working with a coach is so important. Like, the words that you use can really, like, determine the results of what you're trying to achieve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And also to be able to not personalize everything. Like, as soon as your partner, you know, says something or has a complaint about something, we immediately personalize it. We immediately, like, make it about ourselves. We immediately, like, yeah, take it personally. And sometimes we need to just stop doing that for a second to know, like, okay, I know that this. She's talking about my behavior or how I didn't do this, but what is really going on here? Like, what's underlying here? Instead of we. We just get our backs up so easily. And it's natural. It's so natural because we feel like we're on the. The. The defense and we need to protect ourselves. It's our ego talking, and that comes from just really doing some work on your own. You know, we.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do talk a lot about how people wait so long before they go to therapy, and that typically is. Is too late because most men don't want to go to therapy because they feel like they get in there and their wife's got this laundry list of all these things that they've done wrong over the years, and they just like walking into the courtroom as a defendant. You know, they feel ganged up on in there. They feel like they can't win because it's just this constant unloading that I need to do in front of someone else so they can justify that I am right to feel this way of all the things that you've done to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if people can do their own work, use therapy as a way to understand yourself before you use it as a tool to fix the couple, then I think that we would do much better that way. And, you know, everyone needs to maybe the word therapy, maybe do coaching instead for men, because I think that it's scary. People don't want to go into themselves and look at their patterns, but it's about learning about you. Why is it that I get so defensive when people say this, you know, to me, or, you know, why is it that I communicate in this way? Why is it that I shut down? Why is it that I do these things? Just to understand how you're showing up in life, regardless of whether or not you're in a relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how do I handle these conversations with my kids, with my boss, with my friends? Like, this is why we do these. This work is to really learn about ourselves so that we can become better in all areas of life, including our relationship. And if we've done both individually, done a little bit of work on that, it's going to be far easier to come together when things are struggling and falling apart. And I think it's, you know, when we go back to that theme of today is talking about falling out of love. It's like when you are going in a. When you're in a relationship for so long, and it's like a death by a thousand paper cuts. It just erodes the love and respect that you have for each other because you're just not. You're not working on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou're not being clear about what you need. And so when you're kind of missing each other like two ships in the night, then eventually that love does erode because you're not connecting in that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And what you brought up, too, about couples therapy, maybe it is kind of antiquated, you know, thing. It sounds like what you. The service you provide is a little different than couples therapy, even if it's just the framing. Is it the same kind of thing? Because I think people hear couples therapy and they're like, oh, great, yeah, it's over. Or it never works. Like, how do you differentiate, you know, what you do and you teach from the typical couples therapy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, so I don't. I don't work with couples particularly, but I do work with each partner if they want help understanding their relationship. So I work usually with the one person who's kind of got their foot out the door, the one that's contemplating whether or not, should I stay or should I go? Has this relationship run its course? Can my marriage be saved? And I don't work necessarily with the past. So therapy, you know, there's lots of different ways you can look at therapy, but therapy is about unpacking those patterns for yourself. In terms of why I am the way I am. What I do is look at what your relationship is and what's going on in it right now. So I do what's called a relationship audit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sit down for two hours and really do almost like a deep dive diagnostic of what's going on in your relationship. We look at 11 core components of what makes a healthy relationship And I give you a score like how well are we doing in communication? How well are we doing and you know, our goals and our values, or our future vision or how we parent, or how we manage finances, or even how our, you know, sexual and physical intimacy is. And so we get to really see, first of all, where you guys are thriving in the relationship, what's working. Then we look at what's not working, you know, what's possible to fix and bring back on track, and what do you even want to fix at this point?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then looking at, you know, am I still emotionally and mentally in this marriage or have I already checked out? And so from there we get a real good sense of basically where does your relationship stand and where are you standing in it right now, and what does that mean for you? Do you want to work on some of these low-score areas so that you can see if you can get it back on track, or is this confirming what you already know to be true? It's that maybe it's run its course, and it's time to face the truth about that. So I typically work with that one-sided person and who's questioning, and you know, it allows them permission to feel what they're feeling and to see it in almost like a data sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople love to see results like tell me how I'm doing, give me a score like grade my relationship, almost, you know, how are we doing, and what's possible. So that's sort of, that's the type of session I do in the relationship audit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I think it's helpful too for people to have somebody that's been through it, be able to look at it, and give them a more objective viewpoint. But the score, too, it's like when things aren't going well, you might feel like we're at a 1. In reality, you might look at it and be like, well, you're probably at like a 5 and that might be easier. But you're, it's so isolating. Nobody really understands it. Your family or friends that might be married that aren't talking about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So I think it's very, you can get like this like echo chamber where all you think is like it's over and reality you'll be like, oh, you could use some work on the physical, but this is going well and you've got, you know, a bunch of young kids so you're probably not seeing each other as much. So, just if you're going to make a decision as Big as divorce. If nothing else, like, it's worth it to invest and get the peace of mind that, like, you know what, this really was the best decision for me instead of, you know, did I make the right decision? I just wasn't happy. And you look back with regret about that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah. And I think that's also the difference in therapy is so many people that come to me have been in therapy for a long time. They have been, they've literally been spinning their wheels. You know, they have not gotten anywhere. They've spent hours and hours and lots of money spent just getting no answers. And so that's why I created this, so that you can stop seeing, spinning those wheels, you know, and really get a sense of where you're at and what you're doing and what you want to do from here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yes. Some might even say some therapy can be a little bit of a cycle where it's like up, stay in it. We'll work on that next week. It sounds like working with you, there's an objective you're going to get to a point, and it is more like a coaching thing versus like, let's talk about why you're feeling like this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: One more question here. We hear a lot of. Is it selfish to leave a marriage because you're unhappy or to stay in a marriage where you've checked out?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That is such a good question. And I, you know, I truly believe that your relationship should be bringing you joy. It should be really a place where it brings you value, that you feel like this person brings value to my life, and in ways that I can't, and that it is joyful. I mean, marriage is hard. It's going to be hard, but it should be more happier than sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you feel like you're not connected with that person for whatever reason that is, then it's almost like you're holding your partner hostage to you because they, first of all don't deserve to be in a relationship where they're not fully loved and respected and adored like they deserve, you know, just like you do and you know, give them their time back, stop wasting their time, you know, in this relationship with you when you're not fully in it. I mean, it's not exactly very fair to be holding on to someone when you know that you're almost living a lie there. To me, that's the bigger betrayal. Regardless of someone out else ex, you know, externally in your relationship, the bigger betrayal is being in there or lying and pretending that you feel a way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That you don't and only you'll know that you're people will call you selfish or, you know, your ex will be angry. But right at the end of the day, like, this is your life, and you know, take your time with the decision. But like, yeah, you do owe it to yourself, right? And to your kids. You know, that's the other piece we don't really talk about is like sticking around for the kids until they're in college or out of the house. Like, it might have some benefits, but it might have some, you know, plenty of costs too. And those are things that you want to weigh in your decision. For somebody listening right now, like, who's wondering, is this it? Any like, parting words of advice, and relatedly how they can connect with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCindy\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So the best way to connect with me is to follow me on \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.instagram.com/cindy.stibbard/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eInstagram @ Cindy.Stibbard\\u003c/a\\u003e. That's where I live most of the time. So come on over to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.instagram.com/cindy.stibbard/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eCindy.Stibbard\\u003c/a\\u003e, and you'll see lots of content. And if you're interested in connecting with me and finding out more about the audit, then head on over to there. There's a link in my bio to book a quick 15-minute call so we can chat about whether or not that's the best fit. And my website is \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cindystibbard.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eCindyStibbard.com\\u003c/a\\u003e, so if you're interested, if you feel like you're on the fence, if you're still considering divorce, and that's why you're listening to this podcast and you're not sure if you want to, then get really clear on that first.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, it's so important to really know why you're asking for this, why you want this, and is that the right fit for you and is it the right fit for you right now? You know, there's always a time and a place. It's never the right time, but there is a better time than others for certain people. And, maybe taking this time to really get deep and knowing where your relationship stands, where you stand in it, is the most important first step in really getting clear on making that decision before you make it so true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And your content, for people that aren't on Instagram, almost every day there's like a 30-second, one-minute video that really speaks to the heart of what you are feeling. And I think that's why your content resonates so much with people, because you have been through it, and it's like you can read their minds. You're like, have you thought about this?

Others have wills, trusts, and powers of attorney signed during marriage, but after divorce, it is generally safe to assume not only a change of intentions as to how the estate should be distributed, but also the effect of automatic legal changes to the function of existing estate documents. While, in many states, the law revokes provisions benefitting a former spouse once a divorce occurs, such revocation should not be relied upon as a substitute for a new estate plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue peace of mind comes when you have worked with your estate attorney, financial advisor, and other trusted professionals to ensure that you sign new, appropriate estate documents and that your account titles and your beneficiary designations are working in concert with such documents to properly direct your estate plan.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022whytimingmatters\\u0022\\u003eWhy Timing Matters\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nMany people delay the estate planning process until they experience eye-opening events like the death of a loved one or the receipt of a grim diagnosis. Delay, however, may be costly. I once worked with a client, Elizabeth, who endured a horrible divorce after thirty-two years of marriage. Elizabeth did not have a financial advisor, attorney, or CPA working with her in the management of her financial life, and it never occurred to her to update her estate plan; she just assumed that if she were to be hit by the proverbial bus, everything she had would pass to her three adult children. A year after Elizabeth’s divorce was final, her mother died, and Elizabeth spent three years administering the estate. Once her mother’s estate was closed – four years after her divorce – she came to me to help her create a new estate plan, explaining that she did not want her estate to be difficult to carry out like her mother’s had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documents Elizabeth signed while married looked OK upon first glance. Georgia, like many states, treats an ex-spouse as deceased for purposes of one’s will and powers of attorney once a divorce is final, so all references in Elizabeth’s will to her ex-husband were effectively voided, and the will would function to direct any assets in Elizabeth’s name at death to her children. There were, however, some issues. Elizabeth and her ex-husband chose successor executors together, so her successor was her ex-husband’s cousin. Her retirement account still listed her ex as the primary beneficiary, and beneficiary designations supersede the terms of a will. Her bank accounts listed her husband as a transfer-on-death beneficiary, also superseding the terms of her will. Finally, despite the fact that the divorce agreement allocated the house to Elizabeth, the deed to her home - which included her husband - had never been changed to remove him. Had Elizabeth died before addressing these issues, her ex-husband - not the children - would have inherited nearly everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese types of oversights happen far too often, and once someone is gone, it is generally too late to fix them.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022wheretobegin\\u0022\\u003eWhere to Begin\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf you are divorced, now is the time to meet with your financial advisor and an estate planning attorney to address the creation of your new estate plan, with the following items as the initial items of focus:\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWill and/or Revocable Living Trust\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nThese are the central documents that address how one’s assets pass upon death, who oversees the management of the assets, when it is appropriate to distribute funds from trusts, etc. Following divorce, it is advisable to ensure your will and revocable trust properly and accurately describe your wishes for the administration of your estate. At a minimum, it will likely be necessary to:\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eEnsure the distribution of your estate is described to reflect your goals.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSelect new executors and trustees (people or professionals you trust to administer your estate as planned and manage your affairs fairly and responsibly).\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIf you have minor children, nominate a guardian in your will to be responsible for the care, safety, and support of your children in the event both you and your children’s other parent pass.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePowers of Attorney\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nFinancial powers of attorney allow you to designate individuals to handle your financial affairs if you are alive but mentally incapable of managing them yourself.A medical power of attorney, advance directive for healthcare, and living will – all of which may be separate or combined documents, depending on your estate - allow you to designate individuals to make health care decisions for you if you are unable to make them for yourself and to carry out your preferences regarding end-of-life care.If your ex is listed as the person who would make decisions for you in these documents, then you will likely feel that it is time for a change. Choose someone who understands your values and will act in your best interests.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eBeneficiary Designations\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nBeneficiary designations are the knights of the estate planning chess board; if you do not pay attention to them, they will sneak up and foil your plans. As described in Elizabeth’s example above, your wills and revocable trusts do not control everything. Assets titled jointly with rights of survivorship or as tenants by the entirety pass directly to the joint owner upon death. Retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and payable-on-death accounts pass directly to the named beneficiary when you pass. In the case of both joint titling and beneficiary designations, the title or designation controls, no matter what your will provides. It is therefore imperative to review each asset carefully to ensure that it passes in a manner that is well coordinated with your wishes.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022anewchapter\\u0022\\u003eA New Chapter, A New Plan\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nEstate planning, while processing a major life shift from divorce, may be emotionally charged; however, taking control of your new life’s business is empowering. You may find that, after months of complying with legal requests, arranging parenting plans, and negotiating asset division, estate planning may be the first legal process that makes you feel like you are building something that is yours again. Find an estate planning attorney who listens, understands the nuances of post-divorce planning, and who works well with your financial advisor to ensure a seamless, coordinated plan that reflects your personal goals, values, and relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\",\"_page_content\":\"field_generic_content_template_page_content\",\"contents_title\":\"Table of Contents\",\"_contents_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_title\",\"contents_list_0_title\":\"Your Old Plan May No Longer Work\",\"_contents_list_0_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_0_link_id\":\"#youroldplan\",\"_contents_list_0_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_1_title\":\"Why Timing Matters\",\"_contents_list_1_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_1_link_id\":\"#whytimingmatters\",\"_contents_list_1_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_2_title\":\"Where to Begin - Wills and Trusts, Powers of Attorney, Beneficiary Designations\",\"_contents_list_2_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_2_link_id\":\"#wheretobegin\",\"_contents_list_2_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list_3_title\":\"A New Chapter, A New Plan\",\"_contents_list_3_title\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_title\",\"contents_list_3_link_id\":\"#anewchapter\",\"_contents_list_3_link_id\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list_link_id\",\"contents_list\":4,\"_contents_list\":\"field_generic_content_template_contents_list\",\"bottom_tags\":\"\",\"_bottom_tags\":\"field_generic_content_template_bottom_tags\",\"form_heading\":\"Stay in the \\u003cspan\\u003eKnow\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_form_heading\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_heading\",\"form_short_description\":\"Sign up for DivorceLawyer’s newsletter and join a network that empowers those navigating divorce.\",\"_form_short_description\":\"field_generic_content_template_form_short_description\",\"forms\":\"Footer Form\",\"_forms\":\"field_generic_content_template_forms\",\"overlay_layout\":\"1\",\"_overlay_layout\":\"field_generic_content_template_overlay_layout\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"edit\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/related-articles-card {\"name\":\"acf/related-articles-card\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Discover \\u003cspan\\u003eRelated\\u003c/span\\u003e Articles\",\"_title\":\"field_related_articles_card_title\",\"short_description\":\"Explore more educational content from experts and those who have been there. \",\"_short_description\":\"field_related_articles_card_short_description\",\"articles_source\":\"related\",\"_articles_source\":\"field_related_articles_card_articles_source\",\"article_limit\":\"-1\",\"_article_limit\":\"field_related_articles_card_article_limit\",\"show_cta\":\"yes\",\"_show_cta\":\"field_related_articles_card_show_cta\",\"spacing_top\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_top\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_top\",\"spacing_bottom\":\"normal\",\"_spacing_bottom\":\"field_related_articles_card_spacing_bottom\",\"section_id\":\"related-articles\",\"_section_id\":\"field_related_articles_card_section_id\"},\"align\":\"\",\"mode\":\"preview\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:acf/categories {\"name\":\"acf/categories\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Get Informed.

This step will give your attorney clarity about your objectives and, in addition, foster a spirit of cooperation. In doing this from the start, you are identifying the issues on which you are willing to compromise. With fewer issues to debate, this too should result in a faster agreement and a lessening of fees.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022quickresolutionbonus\\u0022\\u003eQuick Resolution Bonus\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nOffer a “bonus” for quick resolution to avoid a lengthy and costly negotiation. This can be framed in a mutually beneficial manner, for example: \\u003cem\\u003e“If we can conclude our negotiations in three weeks, we should save an estimated $6000 on combined legal fees. I propose we look to compromise as much as possible, and if we can achieve this, I would like to offer this entire $6000 savings to you in addition to the final agreed settlement.”\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nIf accepted, not only will the divorcing couple have use of this $6000 as they restart their lives, but this is also another example of fostering the right energy that can lessen the desire to bicker on minor issues and lead to further savings on legal costs.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022twosettlementproposals\\u0022\\u003eTwo Settlement Proposals\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIn particularly contentious divorces, a great strategy is to ask your attorney to draft two outlines for separation agreements.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing which proposal your spouse gravitates towards can illuminate where to focus to get the deal done. Because communication is commonly at a low point, it is not uncommon for divorcing couples to be making erroneous assumptions. This step can dramatically shorten negotiations.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022dontspeakfirst\\u0022\\u003eDon’t Speak First\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nHave your attorney insist on receiving an initial settlement offer from your\\r\\nspouse’s lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this strategy won’t necessarily reveal where your spouse is likely to compromise, it will help to quickly clarify areas of agreement. Identifying which issues matter to your spouse can save significant legal fees.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022meetfirst\\u0022\\u003eMeet First\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf both attorneys are agreeable, ask your spouse to meet to try to create a list of areas of agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be non-binding and subject to review by respective attorneys. This step can eliminate many negotiation items, resulting in reduced legal fees.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022insist\\u0022\\u003eInsist on a “Special Master”\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nA Special Master is a tie-breaker provision built into the divorce agreement that allows for resolutions of future issues without having to resort to the courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can save significant legal costs and stress after separation. I discuss the mechanics and benefits of a Special Master in much greater detail in my book.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022insist\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nUnfortunately, many people incorrectly view compromise during divorce negotiations as a potential cost or weakness. That is misguided. Most who compromise on the greater quantity of issues realize two benefits. First, thousands of dollars can be saved by minimizing the negotiation process. Second, compromising on the majority of points thereby helps the divorcee and a skilled attorney realize the two or three key objectives and goals that are of paramount importance to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help understand the pure scale of the potential savings, assume the above seven strategies used by each divorce couple nets just a one-time $1000 saving. With an estimated 830,000 divorces per year in the USA, that is just short of a one trillion-dollar saving. On an individual basis, these funds are often desperately needed by the separating couple as they look to move on with their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese seven strategies will help those going through divorce remain strategic and focused, despite the presence of heightened emotions and stress. This should result in a faster deal, a fair agreement, and in doing so, set a framework for a better co-parenting relationship that can benefit the couple and their children for years to come.\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022insist\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B072FNSLKR/about\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022text-decoration: underline;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAndy Heller\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e is a California-based businessman and author of \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://a.co/d/iQMUkDm\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022text-decoration: underline;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eTake the High Road: Divorce with Compassion for Yourself and Your Family\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e.

She helps courts and families understand whether a parent’s drinking poses a real risk and what steps can support healthy co-parenting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The impact of a parent's history of alcohol use on child custody recommendations depends on the nature and severity of their consumption,” says Bradshaw Schmidt. “Specifically, it is assessed whether their alcohol use was problematic, posed risks to their own well-being or that of their children, or resulted in legal consequences such as criminal charges or involvement with Child Protective Services. In cases where such concerns exist, continued monitoring and therapeutic intervention may be warranted.”\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022structured\\u0022\\u003eWhen Courts Order Structured Parenting Plans\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nJudges want to see evidence. They often ask how alcohol use has affected parenting or a parent's ability to function. Bradshaw Schmidt notes that when there is clear concern, courts may order a phased approach to parenting time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If a parent's ongoing alcohol consumption has demonstrably impaired their parenting abilities, co-parenting dynamics, or overall functioning, and they struggle to achieve or maintain sobriety while fulfilling their parental responsibilities, a structured, stairstep approach to parenting time may be appropriate. This may involve an initial period of supervised visitation, mandatory alcohol monitoring or testing, and therapeutic intervention, with subsequent adjustments based on measurable behavioral improvements.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis kind of structure helps everyone know what to expect. Parents who are doing the work to change can demonstrate that progress. Children stay safe and supported along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw Schmidt emphasizes that insight and accountability are often just as important as the test results.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ultimately, an effective evaluation requires a comprehensive assessment of the parent's level of insight into their alcohol use and their demonstrated willingness to implement meaningful and sustained changes.”\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022whatcourts\\u0022\\u003eWhat Courts Look For\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nNot every judge will approach alcohol concerns in the same way. Bradshaw Schmidt explains that evidence requirements can vary by court and jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The evidence required to substantiate the impact of alcohol use on parenting varies depending on the presiding judge, the court, and the jurisdiction of the case. Some courts may order biochemical testing, such as a PEth test or a urine or blood EtG analysis, to assess a parent's alcohol consumption. Additionally, judicial considerations may include the parent's involvement with Child Protective Services or the legal system, the parent’s participation in treatment, therapy, or a Twelve Step Program, well as testimony from witnesses who have directly observed the parent's behavior. If the parent is subject to continuous alcohol monitoring through a device such as \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eSoberlink\\u003c/a\\u003e, reports from that system will also likely be factored into the court’s assessment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCourts are guided by the best interests of the child. That means they need a clear record of behavior, not just concerns or assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my jurisdiction, courts are obligated to make decisions that prioritize the best interests of the child,” Bradshaw Schmidt says. “However, this does not necessarily grant judges the discretion to impose restrictions on a parent's parenting time without supporting evidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases where substance use has created risk, courts want to see that the parent is taking steps to address their behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my experience, when credible evidence demonstrates that a parent is misusing substances—whether during parenting time or in a manner that adversely affects their ability to care for their child or cooperate with a co-parent—the court's primary concern is safeguarding the child. In such cases, courts typically emphasize both protection and rehabilitation, encouraging the parent to seek sobriety and implement meaningful behavioral changes to maintain an active and constructive role in their child's life.”\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022theroleofalcohol\\u0022\\u003eThe Role of Alcohol Testing and Monitoring\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nThere are many types of alcohol testing. Some are more reliable and more enforceable than others. Bradshaw Schmidt has seen the difference firsthand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In family law cases, common challenges with alcohol testing protocols often stem from issues related to timing, consistency, and result distribution. Unclear testing schedules, irregular monitoring, and ambiguous procedures for handling missed tests can undermine the effectiveness of such protocols.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome tests, like urinalysis or random breath tests, don’t provide real-time results and are not built with the success of the test in mind. Others lack facial recognition or tamper detection. These gaps can create confusion, especially if the other parent disputes the outcome or questions the validity of the test.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my experience, court orders that establish detailed requirements—including specific testing dates, times, and clear consequences for noncompliance—are significantly more enforceable than those that lack clarity or leave room for interpretation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitoring tools, like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eSoberlink\\u003c/a\\u003e, fill in many of these gaps with a system designed specifically for the demands of family court. Each test is verified through facial recognition to confirm identity, and results are automatically transmitted in real time to specified contacts. The technology includes built-in tamper sensors and clearly documents missed tests, removing ambiguity from the monitoring process. Reports are time-stamped, easy to interpret, and structured to meet evidentiary standards in custody cases across the country, providing courts with consistent, objective data to support informed decision-making that helps shift focus back where it belongs—on the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more severe cases, courts may also recommend treatment, therapy, or support groups in addition to monitoring.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In cases where substance misuse is more severe, courts may order rehabilitation based on the parent's condition and financial resources,” Bradshaw Schmidt explains. “This could include residential treatment, detoxification programs, inpatient care, or intensive outpatient therapy. Additionally, participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and individual counseling may be required as part of a structured recovery plan.”\\r\\n\\u003ch3 id=\\u0022takingthenextstep\\u0022\\u003eTaking the Next Step\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\nIf alcohol use has become a concern in your custody case, you are not alone.

Randy has represented everyone from celebrities to CEOs and today he's going to share what really happens behind the scenes of a divorce. Randy, thank you for being here today.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThanks so much for having me, Rob.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAbsolutely. Well, let's hop right into it. Randy, you've worked with a lot of high profile clients. What is something most people don't understand about celebrity divorces?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou know, it's going to sound very cliche. Celebrities are just people too, right? Pets are just people too. And they are. I think the hardest thing for a divorce lawyer is to understand it. And any lawyer, any professional who gets approached by or hired by a high profile person is that they're coming to you for something you have to offer. They're not coming to you saying, I'm famous. What can you do for me? You know, if you run into them on the street, it's a different dynamic, but it's, really hard. It was hard for me growing up as a lawyer \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eto understand that people hiring me really, they're coming to me for my expertise, you know, what they do, who they are, is sort of secondary to why they are here. And so, you know, once you cut through that, it's pretty straightforward. The only other thing that is really, you know, at the top of my list is it's okay to talk about their craft, right?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBall players love talking about who's going to the Super Bowl. It's not a bad thing. You don't have to pretend that you're not interested. They are celebrities. They're used to talking about their movies, their TV shows, their industry, their sports. So, and you can have fun with it. There's nothing wrong with saying, Hey, by the way, you know, I've represented a lot of Atlanta Falcons and they all know I'm a Saints fan and we have a fun little back and forth on it. there's nothing wrong with talking about what they do, but that's pleasure.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd then the business side is separate. Okay, let's talk about the family law issues and make sure we focus on that separate apart from the fact that we may have a friendship or a rivalry based on your industry. It's separate and apart.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eRight. Well, that's interesting when you're working with a lawyer, mean, the confidentiality is a part of it, like you say, for everybody. Is there something, is that a piece that's important for them to feel like this will stay between us? This is private or like you're saying, are they just regular people too?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo it's a really interesting question because confidentiality for a celebrity is very difficult, Number one, of course we're going to convince them that it's confidential and I don't want to lose my bar license by telling somebody, hey, you know what so-and-so just agreed to or you know what so-and-so just told me. But it's difficult because a lot of times celebrities are used to having staff. You know, I just got off a phone call where we're preparing an affidavit for a celebrity and they have their manager conveying the facts to us. And is the manager covered by confidentiality? Could...\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou know, the court call that person or could the other side subpoena them. We have to be very careful and bring them under our umbrella of attorney-client relationship. So the hard thing sometimes is to talk to the person themselves. I get so many calls from clients, from athletes, mothers, family members, agents, financial advisors saying, just talk to me about their case. And I do.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut I have to be very careful not to say anything confidential and not to receive anything confidential. I insist that I have a conversation with a celebrity. I cannot represent somebody and never talk to them. I've done it without meeting them because they're in other states and we do it by phone or Zoom. But, know, and I think when I emphasize the fact that I want to talk to them directly, it reminds them that it is going to be confidential. One other point, I can't tell you how many times I've had a high profile \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eperson, somebody who's very successful in their craft, tell me, listen, you know, and I'll kick the parents out and then when we're alone, they say, listen, I know everyone's trying to protect me, but I really want to marry her even if we don't get a prenup or I don't really care how much child support I pay because the child needs it. And you have all these other people surrounding them trying to protect them from the world, which is a good thing.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd then I have this different relationship, which is what is really important to you. I need to know not what's important to your manager, your CPA, your bookkeeper, your parents. I want to know what's important to you. that, you know, once you can cut, that's a little bit different than the average person who usually comes in by themselves and may have a family member sit in the lobby or poke their head in.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat's so interesting you say that because we always talk about how like be careful who you're getting advice from your family. They might want the best for you, but that might not be what you want or that might be not the relationship with your kids. So that's an interesting thing where they're probably trusting you, Randy, more so than like you are my confidant. You are my person.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's amazing to me, and this goes beyond high profile people, I mean it's amazing to me that somebody who has never met me in their life will come in within 10 minutes, bear their soul and tell me all the things they've done wrong and what their wife has done wrong and about their sex life and their drug life. They just met me and I hope they have the trust in me. I hope that's why they're hiring me.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I hope I instill that trust and that confidential nature of our relationship. But it is something that sort of every now and then I look back and say, could I do that? Could I walk into a stranger's office and tell all those things? obviously we have to know that stuff to be able to defend them, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003enot to use it in court, but to know what are you going to be accused of? And if they accuse you of this, what's the explanation? Because the last thing I want is for the other side to say, did you know your client did this, this, and this? And for me to have that deer in the headlights look at my face and say, no, I've got to ask them. Instead, I'll say, I knew you were going to accuse her of that. And let me explain to you what happened. That's the position I want to be in. And that's how I encourage them to be honest with me so that I can be ready for whatever comes.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's probably like a relief in a lot of ways. Like I've been holding this in for so long. Finally, there's somebody I can spill some of my dark secrets to that I can trust is not going to use it against me.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut who can't tell anybody because I know I tell my sister and she promises not to tell anybody, but there's no legal requirement that my sister or my brother or my family member doesn't tell somebody. I've got a legal requirement that if it's confidential and I'm told keep it confidential, I will. If it's something that's got to be in the pleadings, then obviously it goes out there. yeah, that's I agree with you. think sometimes when they leave our office, especially after the first meeting, there's always a sense of relief and it always shocks me. Someone will \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003emeet with us, talk about a lot of things, give us a check. And then they walk out and they say, thank you, I feel so much better. And I say, you feel better. You just hired me and you just gave me some money and I've got a new interesting case. You know, I, I'm the one that should be feeling better. And instead I feel like I've now got a burden. I've got the weight of this person's troubles on my shoulders and they feel like they've dumped everything on us and we're going to help them take care of it. So it's a sort of interesting reverse dynamic of what you would expect. If you would feel at the end of a first meeting with a lawyer.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eTotally. As somebody who's gone through divorce and is not a celebrity, can say there's so much like just build up intention that like that conversation that having somebody like you that has your back, you do leave the office just feeling like this weight off that like, you know, you were just you didn't even realize you were carrying. So I could see how it's got to be even heightened for a celebrity or an athlete or somebody like that has got so many just voices in his ear.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's interesting and it's it's one of the few joys I have in family laws seeing things that other people don't see and realizing I'm in a position to help and I think if we do our job well, we really are helping the family. There are lawyers that don't do their job well; there are lawyers that don't care, but most of us - most of the lawyers that are good that are respected that you hear about, they want to help families. They're not trying to make more money by you know stringing a case along. We've got enough business coming in that if we solve your case I feel better about it.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou feel better about it and you tell folks that we did a good job. You we don't make our money on one case, right? We make it on having a lot of people need us and because we don't have a client the last 20 years. Divorces are relatively quick. know, some last a year or two, but even that is a short period of time. Some lawyers represent people and they do their estate planning their whole life or they do their contracts for their businesses their whole life. We represent people for a short period of time and usually a very difficult time that everyone wants to move beyond.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, and yeah, like you said, if you're on a 54 person NFL football team, just the odds are if 50 % of people are getting divorced, there's probably a few people that are, you know, some teammates that are gonna run into some issues down the road and they could say, oh, hey, who did you use? So yeah, I could see how it's important and just, they can share their story and their success with people that they confide in.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, in particular NFL and NBA folks who are targets, not even just for marriage, but there are a lot of times people want to have babies with athletes. You know, they think that they're going to be rich or they're going to be famous or they're going to be by association. It's going to enhance their life. And, know, sometimes it does. It usually doesn't. But yes, those, those guys are, are, and women sometimes too, but mainly the men in the, in the major sports that are making a lot of money.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThey get targeted and they turn to have locker room talking. say, you know, I'm in that situation. Who'd you use? that's fortunately or unfortunately, that's how we end up with a lot of business from a lot of people on the same team. We're in the same business, same field, the same sport.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDo you find when somebody is not married, let's say they do have a kid with somebody is that also they should they be meeting with a divorce lawyer as well? Is that like a situation where do they have to be married?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e100%. 100%. That's exactly what, you know, we call it family law. The word divorce has sort of evolved in our field to sort of mean, you know, everything family law, custody. You know, you can have a custody dispute when you're not married to the mother or the father. You can have a child support dispute when you're not married to the other parent of the child. So anything that's related to children, custody, support, or if you're about to get married, a prenuptial agreement. You know, there's a lot of cliches that are applicable, you know, the ounce of prevention.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBetter to know what the law is before you get into it. know, if someone says, you know, I'm pregnant with a child of yours, talk to a lawyer, figure out what to do, because we'll talk to you about how do you make it a legal, legitimate relationship \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003einstead of an out of marriage, you know, in the old days, they call that a bastard child. Um, there are things that you should know just so that when the other side goes to a lawyer and says, my lawyer tells me this, you can say, understand because my lawyer told me the same thing, or I think your lawyer is wrong. Um, and the best thing that can happen is for those people who might have all sorts of emotions and feelings and anger and frustration and love to be able to say, listen, we both have good lawyers. Let's let the lawyers talk and figure out what's important to each of us. And I'll talk and I'll say the mom wants \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eto know, dad, do you want to be involved in the child's life? That's what's most important to her. And dad will say, I want mom's lawyer to know that's what's most important to me. Money's secondary. Boy, we started off on the right foot if that's the communication. So yes, talking to a lawyer is always a good first step. The ounce of prevention. Get a little bit of knowledge before you make a mistake.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, and that's when things can get out of hand is when you're sparring back and forth with the mother or father of the child and you haven't talked to a lawyer. So it sounds like make that call and you'll just like, you'll be able to navigate those conversations a lot more confidently and you're mitigating your risk too.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eRight, and you'll have a relationship with the lawyer so that even if nothing happens, and I have folks that come in and hire me and pay me for a consultation and say, I don't have any children yet, but I might. And when it happens, I wanna have the relationship with you for a couple reasons. I wanna be able to call you.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI also want to make sure that the other side can't call you. So there are lot of reasons to just do some pre-planning. And the other thing that's interesting, Rob, to me is these celebrities, artists, musicians, hip hop folks, they're very disciplined. They're very organized. They're talented. But the ones who make it, there's a lot of talented people. There are a lot of talented athletes that never make it to the NFL or NBA. It's the people that not only are talented, but have that discipline and the foresight to plan ahead and think about how do they want to establish their career? Who do they need to meet?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhere do they have to be? What are their hours? What's their nutrition? And they're all very, very organized and disciplined. And I admire them because they have a lot more discipline than a lot of folks. A more discipline than me with what they eat and how they organize their time, how they work out, whatever it is. Their lives are very choreographed. You don't get there just by luck. You might get lucky for a minute, but you're not successful forever just based on luck.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, nobody sees all the work that like goes into it. They just see the success and they're like, they're living the life. And like you said, the discipline and the, you know, the few that do make it. could see it's funny when you talk about, know, they talk about like new players coming into the league and they're very financially unprepared to have all this money. And maybe they do like a seminar or something. I don't know if you're doing it, but I think that'd be a really valuable thing. And like, now we're going to have Randy Kessler come on and talk about if you end up in a situation.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDo that a lot. I do that for the NFL Players Association, for the NBA Players Association. I've spoken to their agents and advisors. I've done it for agents where they gather a group of folks and really I give them war stories and horror stories about people that have made a mistake. But that's another one of those things that really surprised me. I see 17 year old kids, the day they become millionaires or the day that they make this money and they figure out stuff. The ones that are successful, they figure out.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI need to plan for retirement. I need to plan for disability. I've got my good agent is telling me and my good financial advisors telling me to start putting money away for my kids college. I mean, I don't know about you. I didn't think about retirement plans and life insurance until I was, you know, 30, 40 years old, had a child. You know, who thinks that when you're 17, 18, they have to figure out life, at least their financial life early on before it's all gone. You know, you know, when you get money at a young age.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou gave me $5 million when I was 18 years old. I don't know if I still have it today. Those that make it, they've got good people in their ear, good guidance, and they've got some good brains and some good sense of discipline.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIf there is a athlete celebrity listening right now that whether they've gotten into some issues, is there one piece of advice you would give to them as they're about to navigate this high profile part of their life where there will be men and women and a lot of flashy distractions?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRandy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, aside from talk to a lawyer and understand your rights and all that, yes, in fact, this was the theme of one of my presentations that I was talking about. Two words, be nice. You don't get custody because you're rich. You don't get custody because you're famous. You don't get time with your child because you're successful. You know why you get it? Being nice. Paying me a lot of money to go to court to get you guaranteed time is one way. The easier way?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBe nice as hard as it is. If you feel like you were sucker punched or they took advantage or you don't like their family, doesn't matter. If that's the mother of your child or the father of your child, be nice. Try to get people to do things voluntarily. You'll save a lot of money on lawyers and it will work out better in the long run. The people that are nice, they get that even though they know the other side is not being nice, is angry, they have a much better time down the road. And what goes around comes around.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eGiving them tickets to the games showing up for birthday parties, know sending memorabilia, whatever it is Be nice as hard as it is Be nice to the other side because 90 % of the time Rob we work matters out by negotiation Only in the extreme cases do we have to go to court and have the judge tell everybody what's gonna happen If you can negotiate a resolution, it's gonna be more nuanced It's gonna take into account your birthday your special occasions your religion her religion his religion\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBe nice. Two words.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI like that. That's a great place to end on. It's like the stars, they're just like us. And Randy, this was really informative. I I learned things about celebrity divorces that I had a misconception about them.

You never know where people find you, whether it's a podcast or social. it's easier said than done, but you got to be everywhere today.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI know you're 100 % right.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, let's get right into it since you've dealt with many people going through all stages of divorce. How is somebody supposed to make rational decisions when they're in the middle of something as emotional as divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's again, simple, not easy. You deal with the emotions first because they will always cloud your judgment, get in the way, make you spin in circles so that you don't see the answer that's really best for you and that's right in front of your face. So I always tell people step number one is to deal with how you feel.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eStep number one is to deal with how you feel.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, what might that look like? that something a divorce coach helps with? that I've been like, there's a lot of it's almost like a team you can construct when you're going through divorce.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou absolutely need a team, I think. It's just like it takes a village to raise a child. It takes a team to go through a divorce, at least if you want to do it well. But in terms of dealing with your emotions, there's a lot of choices available to you. A good divorce coach is obviously number one. Number two, a good therapist, like somebody to talk to. You're not into therapy? Okay, get a support group. There's a lot of support groups, both online and offline these days. You can talk about your issues there, and that's people \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eyou're going to be around people who are also going through it and can talk to you rationally. You can also talk to your friends. Eventually you're going to burn them out, but you know, for a while you can talk to them about everything that you're going through. So you have a lot of options, but the point is not to keep it all bottled up inside, not to try to keep the stiff upper lip as the British would say. But to let you, let yourself feel your emotions and deal with them because the only way out is through.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat's a great thing. always, like you said, simple, not easy, but resistance is futile. You do have to lean into it. It's gonna be painful. We can talk a little bit about the friends and the family that you wanna rely on or not always the best people to help get you through it. I like what you said really about like a team, but talk a little bit about, I've been in the \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003edivorce space now five years having gotten divorced. I didn't know what a divorce coach was. I tell people about it today and they don't know what is why would I need a divorce coach? What? What is a divorce coach? And how is it different than I've got an attorney already?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eOkay, a divorce coach fills the gaps that your lawyer will leave. And I know your lawyer will leave them because I was a divorce lawyer for more decades than I care to admit to. So I understand what a lawyer does is they help you with the legal part of your divorce. But for most people, the legal part is about 10%. The other 90 % is the emotional part, the psychological part.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eA divorce coach fills the gaps that your lawyer will leave....\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThe practical part, where do you live, when do you move? It's your kids, it's your family, it's your real estate. It's so many things. And so a divorce coach helps guide you through the whole process. I like to tell people that I help them to become the CEOs of their divorce. And it's not a job that anybody ever wanted necessarily, but they think their lawyer is gonna fill their role. I'm here to tell you.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYour lawyer is not going to do that for you. They're only gonna take care of the legal stuff and they are your most expensive divorce professional. So to the extent that you can find other people to fill in the gaps and help give you that roadmap, that guide through this, you gotta do this and this and this and this, and you've gotta do the right things in the right order, that's what I as a coach help my clients to do and to get the resources and the courage in themselves \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eto do the things that they need to do. Because sometimes it's like you look at that big stack of paperwork on your desk or your table or your whatever, and you're just like, I don't want to deal with it. Well, I help my clients deal with it and find a way inside of themselves to find the stamina and the courage and the fortitude to tackle the paperwork pile. And then they give their lawyer a nice organized set of documents, whether that's digitally or paper. And that saves them an enormous amount of time, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ean enormous amount of money and it helps them feel good about themselves because the more empowered you can be as you go through this process, the better you're going to do all the way along and at the end.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd you hit on something there that I think is the key to everything. What are most people's biggest complaint about divorce? It takes forever and I'm draining my entire bank account. And it's counterintuitive that like, I think people are like, I already paid my divorce attorney or retainer, you want me to pay more money? And it seems like bringing on a coach as just part of your team, while it might be l\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eaying out a little money, seems like it could save you a ton because now you don't have to do all the work yourself and it's and the lawyer is not charging you $500 an hour to send an email, whereas something like you yourself or a team can help you with.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e100%. So what the coach brings is not just less expense, but less conflict, more choice, more control, and more empowerment. You can either go through your divorce and have it totally devastate you and wreck your life, or you can say, you know what, this is a lousy situation. This isn't something that I ever wanted to have happen, but I'm going to learn through it. I'm gonna make the best of it. I'm gonna grow. And at the end, you...\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI promise you, you can be a totally different person and be like really proud of yourself that, I made it, did these things, and now you're ready for the next step instead of getting to the end of your divorce and being so trashed that you need 10 years of therapy to get yourself back on your feet.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eMm hmm. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it seems like you were you were pretty early on in the divorce coaching world, probably because you were a divorce lawyer. Do you find most divorce lawyers are receptive to divorce coaches? Is there? No.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eNot really. Not really. mean, some are. What's interesting is the younger ones are, the more progressive ones are, the ones who see the gap are. But let's be honest, if I'm doing my job with you, my client, the lawyer's not making as much money. However, the lawyer is making, like I make better clients for lawyers and better lawyers for clients. So the lawyer may not make as much money on that, on each person, but t\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ehere's plenty of work out there, right? So they're going to have a larger client base, happier clients, more satisfied clients. And guess what? Satisfied clients refer.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAbsolutely. I think that's the piece of like, everybody has this one client that's just dragging them down, taking all their time away. And it's like, if you could wave a magic wand and like all of your clients be a breeze and be prepared, like, isn't that something you'd want? So yeah, it's very interesting. That's why we at, know, WTF Divorce and DivorceLawyer.com, we preach education and preparation. It's so important.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ebut it's also so overwhelming to do on your own. So I think that's like the piece of like, I know I should do all this, but the stack of papers and it's like, I think a lot of people just don't even know that a coach can help get you from A to B.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd you just said something really important, was my motivation to go from lawyer to coach, and that's the education piece. So I was practicing law. I always only wanted to be a solo in my own business. I didn't want to be an empire. So it was me, my secretary, and a client in the office one day, and it was hot. So I had my door open.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd you know, I was doing my thing and the client leaves and my secretary who had worked for all the big firms in town. All right. She was, you she was done with them. She moved to me and the client leaves. And she said, you know, no one else does that. Right. And I said, what, what did I do? And she said, you sat down and you told them you spent time with them. And you said, here's mediation, here's collaborative divorce, here's litigation, here's all your choices, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd here's how you choose. And now you just got to make a decision. And I said, well, if the other lawyers aren't doing that, what are they doing? And she said, here's a contract sign here. And I said, my God, that's wrong. I mean, it's not my life. I understand how all this works. People don't. And it's my job to educate and empower them. And she's like, yeah, well, no one else does it. And so that got me investigating and going down the road of coach and saying, okay,\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThis is the job of what a coach does. And without that education, you can't make good decisions. I mean, let's be honest, you can't make a decision if you don't even know you have one. So I help fill in those gaps. then, realistically, what I realized is the lawyer isn't necessarily gonna tell you what all your options are. They're gonna tell you what they do. So the litigator is gonna say,\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eTotally.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWe can go to court. I will fight for your rights. We can win this. The mediator is going to say, you know, we can work it out. And it's the same you in the same circumstances, but they're coming at it from different ways. And you're so emotional as a client that what you hear is, this is what I need. But all they're telling you is this is what I do.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's a great reframe. It's almost like a realtor taking you to a house and be like, this is a great house for you. And they just want to sell the house and like they might not even know that you're like, we, want this and that. So yeah, I think it's an interesting thing where there's so much information and education is so important, but you're also just like drowning emotionally. So it's like a weird thing where I know I need to do this. And that's why I think I mean, having been in the divorce space now, the power of a divorce coach is it's\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's so important, but also like, I don't think it's talked about enough. I don't think enough people like they catch the window. I mean, is it too late once you've started your divorce with an attorney to hire an attorney coach?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eNo, I mean, I work with people, I take them from the point where they're trying to make the initial decision of do I stay or do I go, because that's a place people get stuck for years. And then if they decide I wanna stay married, great, wonderful, awesome, let me get you resources and help you do that better. Because if you were happy in your marriage, you're not talking to me. If you decide you're gonna go down the path of divorce, great, wonderful, let's make a plan.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eTo do that in the way that works for you, that works for your kids, that works for everybody. If people are already in the middle of their divorce, a lot of people come to me as a coach because of my legal background to say, you know, I don't know if my lawyer has my back. And then I say, okay, let's talk about that. Bring me all your stuff. Let me look at everything and we will talk about whether they have your back or not. And what I found is that a lot of lawyers, notwithstanding, were paid to communicate for a living.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDon't communicate particularly well with our clients. And people don't wanna brag or blow their own horn or whatever. And so sometimes the lawyer is doing a bang of job for the client. see what they've done and I'm like, you should be kissing the ground they walk on. This is amazing. And the client is like, really? Wow. But as a lawyer, if you say that, you sound like an idiot, right? And then other times I look what the lawyer has done and I'm like, well,\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eCan I give you some names? Maybe you want a second opinion. But people start to wonder because the process can take so long. Halfway through, like, they lose faith, they lose confidence. And so I work with people there. The other thing that I do as a divorce coach, because I have such extensive trial experience, I can help you get ready for a hearing, a custody evaluation, for a trial, for all of the things because\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThe lawyer thinks they're gonna prepare you, but let's be realistic, lawyers are busy. Unless you've got a ton of money, in which case the lawyer spends a lot of time with you, but if you don't wanna spend a ton of money on your divorce, the lawyer is going to prepare you, but their preparation is like ground level, right? And if you want something more than that, if you wanna walk into that hearing or trial or whatever you're walking into, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ewith confidence and knowing that you know what you're doing, that takes time. And so that's what I do with my clients is help them get ready for that because psychology is really the foundation of divorce. If you can walk in, you get control of your own head and you walk in with confidence.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou are an entirely different person. And that hearing is going to go fundamentally differently than if you walk in and you're nervous and you're upset and you haven't slept the night before and all the things, right?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, it's a great way to look at it. And I like what you said too about getting a second opinion. We always hear about get multiple divorce consults, but sometimes you still sign with somebody. And then you're like, I talked to two lawyers, I picked this one. And it sounds like get multiple opinions, maybe that checkpoint halfway through your divorce or it's stuck. It's like there's still time to like, get some insight and you're not going to really get it from your family or your friends. So\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, this is another place where a divorce coach could be very helpful in just getting the thing moving again.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, it's like, look, you always have choices. They may not always be great choices, but you always have choices. It's about finding the guide who can lay those out for you and say, here are the pros and cons of each particular choice. Here's how you make the choice. The choice is yours. There is no divorce professional who's gonna make them for you. Your job is to make the choice, but they can educate you. They can say to you - \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eHere's the consequences of each choice. Here's what's gonna happen based on the years of experience that we've had. We've seen other people in this situation. That's why your family isn't always best. They love you. They want what's best for you fundamentally, but they have their own opinion about what that is and what you should do. And if they have experience with a divorce, it was like, there's one, that's it. Not thousands, just one.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eLet's talk about people throw around the word gray divorce, not everybody knows what that is. But why are you seeing more people after the age of 50 getting divorced today?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo gray divorce is anybody over, it's got different definitions. Some people say over 50, some over 45. Call it what you will, there's hair dye, so nobody's really got to be gray anymore. But over 50, and yeah, that's the biggest demographic of people divorcing these days.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhat's your thoughts on why that is and is that accelerating or the same that is it always was?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI think it's sort of leveled off. It accelerated for a while when the baby boomer generation started hitting their 50s and 60s. And I think the reason is because we live longer, right? So it used to be back in the day at 65 years old, you retired, your social security kicked in, you were only going to live to 68 or 70. And then, you know, at that point, why would you divorce your spouse? Because you're only going to live a couple of years. It's going take you that long to get a divorce. Who cares?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut now when the life expectancy is in the eighties or nineties, people are getting to 60 or 50 or whatever, turning, looking at their spouse, their kids are out of the house, they're strangers, their marriage is completely empty at this point. And they're going, I got another 20 or 30 years. I don't want to live with this person. Or I don't want to live this way. There is more to life I've been putting up with, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is. And I want something different. I want something more.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I think that's a lot of what's fueling the gray divorce revolution, as they call it.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDo you think the kids moving out of the house going to college, is that a common impetus for divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYes, I don't think it's a good impetus, but it's a common one because people say, you know, they know divorce is hard on kids. So let's just wait till the kids leave. Okay. Unless your kids are really, really stupid. They know that when the youngest one moved out and two months later, mom and dad filed for divorce, the only reason you were staying together was because of them. And that causes all kinds of problems that you might not have thought about, right? You think you're doing the best thing. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eParents, l\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eike no parent wants to hurt their kids, right? Unless you're really sick and twisted. So they're trying to do the best thing, but it doesn't always end up being the best thing because the kids feel guilty. The kids feel like it was their fault. Not that the marriage fell apart, but that the parents stayed together. If the kids, if the parents sort of kept a decent relationship on the surface for the kids, a lot of times the kids are blindsided. They feel like, my gosh, was my whole \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003echildhood a lie? Like what was real and what wasn't? You guys were clearly faking it for a long time. So what do I believe? What do relationships mean? So it causes a lot of challenges for older kids that the parents might not think about. So if the only reason you're staying together is the kids, I would encourage people to think long and hard about is that the best decision for your family?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd the answer isn't an automatic yes. It might be yes, but it might be no.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhat do you think the reason is people say, I know I want to get divorced, but we're not going to do it until the kids are out of the house.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: B\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eecause they don't want to the kids. They want it to be easier on them. But, you your youngest just went off to college. So they are a freshman in college. Their whole life is different. They're living in a dorm. They're doing all the things. And then they get the call from mom and dad. yeah, by the way, we're getting divorced. We're selling the house. Your whole every, you know, come get your stuff or tell us what you want and we'll put it in storage. And their world is turned upside down.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's an interesting reframe - I a lot of people think staying together for the kids is better for them because their lives won't be disrupted. But it sounds like you're just delaying the disruption and it might actually be better to get divorced if it, you know, every situation is different. But to think you're shielding them from this pain is like, is kind of just fooling yourself, it sounds like.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's always gonna be painful. I mean, let's be honest. But you have to look at, and this is again, getting back to the discussion about a divorce coach. This is one of the things that I help people figure out because every family is different, every marriage is different, every divorce is different. What's right for you? This isn't cookie cutter. You can go get all these great theories, but your particular circumstances might call for you to do A instead of B. Okay, great.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eEvery family is different, every marriage is different, every divorce is different\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eKnow what your choices are, and then figure out which one is going to be best for your family, for you, and for your kids. You you can have, I don't know how many kids you have, but you know, I've got four. So each one is very different and you can do exactly the same thing to all four kids and you get four different reactions and it just, it's very, very different. So you've got to look at what people are you dealing with and trying to protect and how are they likely to h\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eandle things.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, no, it's a great way to look at it. Yeah, I've got three kids and they do all handle it differently. So to think you can just steer the ship and avoid it. It's like, it's coming for you one way or another. It's just to your point. What's the healthiest way to handle it? What's the most, you know, honest real way to go through it. And we're all gonna step in some potholes along the way. So there's no avoiding that. But I think the lesson that we learned from these conversations is like, don't do it alone and do it with somebody w\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eho has been there, who understands your situation, who has professional experience because like it could just save you such heartache, headache, money, time that like you're, it's a no brainer. It's just a lot of us is like helping explain that to people and guide them.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eKaren: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou know, I think it's because in the world today, we're living in a digital world and there's so much information. I mean, we're drowning in information and starving for wisdom and knowledge. And that's the reason, the real reason you need a team today. It's not about, you know, going on chatgpt and saying, how do I get a divorce? It will give you an answer, but it doesn't give you all of your options. And it doesn't give you an answer that tells you.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ehis is what you should do, this is why, here's the pros and cons. It's an information dump, which in some ways is even more overwhelming because you're already overwhelmed emotionally and now you're overwhelmed with data and you're like, now I really don't know what to do, right? So what you need is the guide, the team to help you through and say, okay, this is this piece, this is this piece, this is this piece. These are how all the pieces relate to each other.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd this is how this process typically works and the outcomes that we've seen.

So it's refreshing. It seems like it's a female dominated divorce world is what I find.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYes, but typically it takes two to tango, so...\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eExactly. So Andy, you're a businessman, not a therapist. Why? What led you to write a book about divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI'll try to give you my story in like two minutes so we can leave time for questions, Rob. So I'm a successful businessman. I've co-authored two real estate investing books. I run my own international freight forwarding company and I had a challenge in divorce and everybody has a different coping mechanism when they have stress. With me, I take notes and I don't sleep a lot and I read. So I read a lot of other books on divorce as I went through my own drama.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI'm writing notes and all and a couple years into my own divorce, something happened and I, something happened with my ex and I'm like, you know what, I'm, I know how I'm going to deal with this, but I actually had a therapist and I'm a pretty together guy, Rob, but I found a therapist who did a lot of work with divorce, man. It was, it was just helpful to have a sound board.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo before I made my decision on this issue, went to, I said, I'm gonna talk to her about it. I went, I said, this is what happened, but don't worry, I thought it through, and this is what I'm gonna do. And just a little bit about me, I'm a very compromise-oriented guy, I wasn't out to hurt my ex or anything. And she said, well, Andy, it's really great you thought it through, blah, blah, blah, blah. She went into all the therapy speak, and then she said, but you're not gonna do what you intend, you're gonna do the opposite. I'm like, but, but, but. And as soon as I shut my mouth and I let her talk,\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhat she said made a lot of sense. And she said, if you do what I am suggesting within a year, your situation is going to improve. So I took her suggestion and she was wrong. It took three months. And what happened, I looked at my notes. talked about, I thought about what happened that session. And I recognize even though I'm a pretty together guy, I realized the degree to which I was emotionally compromised and not making good decisions.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd then I looked at my notes. I thought about all these other books I read and I saw, you know what? I've got an outline here for a great book because all these books that I read, there's really a gap in a divorce book space and I can fill this gap. So what I mean by that, you said, like in the introduction, I'm not an attorney, I'm not a therapist. All of these books tend to be, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003every specific and coming from a certain vantage point. The divorce attorney, like how to pick a good attorney. A therapist, how to speak to your kids when they're getting divorced. What's the right relationship with the ex? Now, most people are not like me, Rob. They don't have time to read dozens of books. They might read one or two. So what I did, I started a seven year project of interview and field experts, because I'm not an expert.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut I interviewed attorneys, interviewed co-parenting counselors, I interviewed therapists, I interviewed children therapists, I interviewed couples who had toxic divorces but are landed in good co-parenting places. And so my book is organized like a business plan. And it's unisex is valuable for women as is for men. And it's about how to manage and get through a divorce with your head on straight.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eLead a good life going forward, have the right relationship with your ex, and most importantly, co-parent with your kids correctly. And yeah, so I'm really humbled by the reviews and the feedback. And I don't mean to be corny, but this isn't my money-making path. I've got a successful business. This is kind of a payback to everybody who helped me out. And yeah, so excited to be here.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eOh, it's awesome. I find it very relatable because like you, I'm not a coach. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not an expert. But I found just going through it, especially as a guy, it seems like there wasn't a lot of information or it wasn't like, it was kind of counterintuitive. Like you're saying the things like you're emotionally feeling are different than I like how you even frame it as like a business plan. Like, talk a little bit about like, what's an example of maybe how you \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eemotionally would naturally want to go through something and then how you reframed it in the book and using the experts as a business plan and like the benefits of that.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSure. So I know that a lot of the audience are attorneys and people seek an attorney. So let me speak to that part of the book where it talks about how to be, I think the right words I'll use is how to present yourself as an easy to work with client to an attorney, which will also in turn help you minimize your expenses.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd the good attorneys will say this is exactly what they need to do. So during a divorce, particularly in the early months and years, that's when we human beings are at our worst. So we're not operating really effectively. We're very hurt in many cases. So part of the book talks about when you A, how to select an attorney, B, what is the right divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eStrategy do you want to do like a kitchen table divorce? Is it gonna be a litigate divorce collaborative divorce? But important very important Part of the book talks about the need we divorce these have when we go to an attorney to be very clear with what we say to the attorney and give the attorney one to maximum three of your key goals and compromise elsewhere\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo if I had to do it over again, Rob, I would have picked a different title because the title, Take the High Road implies you're compromising everywhere. That's actually not the case. It's more about focusing on the big picture, not on who gets the kitchen plates. All right. So compromise on the minor details and enable and empower your attorney with clear direction what's important to you.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBy forcing yourself to give the attorney two things, only two things that are absolute key objectives, it's going to help your attorney compromise on the dozen things that are not important and help you achieve the two or three things that are really are important. So I guess we could call this proper management of your attorney, your legal structure and \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eso many divorces waste tens of thousands of dollars because they're not able to give their attorneys the right guidelines. So that's an example, forcing yourself when you're emotionally off to be very focused in your direction with your attorney.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eMakes a lot of sense too, because I think everybody's biggest complaint about divorces is they take forever, they cost so much. And a lot of it is because we just hand the keys to the attorney and they say, figure this out, I don't want to deal with it. And that sounds like sounds like you're saying, you need to take ownership, you need to, you know, rely on your attorney as the expert, but you need to lead this and find out what are the most important things. And then alongside that, what are the things you are willing to \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003elet go of. And I think a lot of us, easy to say from hindsight, when it's the emotional fog that you're in, that part of your brain tends to tends to shut off. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, I mean, I exactly. another great example, a great tip there is, okay, if you have limited funds, all right, and you're afraid of those being one of those divorces that takes years, give a quick resolution bonus. All right, so, all right.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI'll give more custodial time. I'll give a bit more money if we can finish in a month and wrap it up and call it a day. Okay, that's a win-win and attorneys will like that. They can close the book on your divorce and you guys can be a reference for the attorney getting a resolution done really quickly. mean, attorneys love to have a client \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ewho gives them clear direction and where they can close the file quickly. And good attorneys will approach that as a win-win.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eRight, absolutely. What would you say to people, you know, they're going through it, it's such an emotionally charged thing, you can only understand it, if you've gone through it, where maybe there was cheating, maybe there's vindictiveness, maybe you want to be agreeable, but your ex doesn't. How do you any guidance you have on like, while you're holding those feelings, to also have compassion and empathy, like, how do you hold those two things at once when you're going through it?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, let me first acknowledge what you've said. It's really, really difficult. It's tough to have compassion when you're really, in many cases, you're hurt or you're upset. The advice I'm gonna give everybody is gonna be, it's really good advice. It may not seem like the ideal advice for this.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhat I talk about in the book is the need to have a vision and a role model, a vision for what you want your life to look like in a couple of years and a role model. I talk in my book about a guy named Hans and Hans was an entrepreneur like me. And when I met with him, I mean his life, I recall meeting with him for business and he couldn't have a sentence straight Rob.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBecause his wife had fallen in love or thought she was in love with an 18 year old aerobics instructor. And you can imagine, I mean, not only was his life crumbling, he was a bit embarrassed. It was a really bad time. And I saw him at his worst. Five years later, he had a wonderful girlfriend. He was getting along well with his wife, ex-wife, sorry. His kids were being raised e\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003effectively in two households. I never would have predicted that five years ago. So it's very important for a divorcee to have color role model, call it just somebody, the picture of somebody who went through the challenges you're going through, and this is a man or a woman, and he or she has landed in a place that's healthy. And that will help you when you're at your worst.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBecause this person you know had a life that was very similar to you five years earlier, but look where they are now. And that can help you to be kinder and compassion because you know that life will look differently down the road.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, that makes a lot of sense. say how important it is, especially for guys, I think to find somebody that has been through it. Hopefully, you know, and you'll find a lot of people that are very bitter. But if you can find somebody with a healthier post divorce life, because it is I always say it gets harder before it gets easier. And like, I sometimes think that like, forcing this expectation of like, I should be happier now. I'm not dealing with that or like, my family and friends or say, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eyou weren't meant to be together anyways, or you'll find somebody else. Sometimes that can break your brain. So giving yourself some grace for like, it's just a really hard time right now or like this year is just, I'm going to write it off to it's going to be a mess, but in two, three years, I'm going to get there. So I think like that's really tough, like mental thing where you're like holding that it's hard right now and it's going to be better in the future. But you just can't skip to where Hans was five years later.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, I want to speak to two things you mentioned because I do talk about both of them in the book. Unfortunately, my gender, we tend to hold more things in. Women tend to be far more in touch with their feelings. I'm being kind of generalized in here. Women tend to be more inclined to seek help than a man. So I do believe it's healthy \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eto let yourself feel like crap because it is a tough time. But because of that, don't do this on an island. Get yourself the right sound and boards. And I'm a massive believer in personal therapy. And when I had a very, very toxic divorce and we had a co-parent counselor and she could see that both of us were struggling. And she said,\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI highly recommend that you both find individual counselors, therapists to get you through this. And I said, look, I'm open to it. I'm a pretty grounded guy, but I want somebody specifically who's worked with divorced men. So, and that person was really helpful. So to the first point, absolutely. It's okay to feel bad, but don't get off that island and get the right support system.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd this is not a friend, okay? This is a trained professional to guide you, because it's going to be a rough patch, okay? The second point, you talked about people giving advice. When you announce you're getting divorced, everybody and their brother are going to come up with advice, family, friends, coworkers, all with the best intention, like what you said. You weren't intended to be together in the first place.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat's not helpful, okay? So this is gonna be a bit, go against what your tendency is. Your tendency will be to talk to many. Don't. Find the Hans in your life, or the Hans Sol or the Hans, all right? Find somebody who reminds you of you.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eHave a challenge and divorce and he or she has landed in a healthy place. Their kids are being raised well, their co-parenting well, all right? And they've moved on. Not necessarily, it doesn't mean they have to have a new partner, but they've moved on to a point where they are healthy. That person is your sounding board. Everybody else, you're like, you know what? It's better for me.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIf we just don't talk about the drama, I don't want to talk about my ex, so whatever. Let's just be friends and let's just be family and hang out. And that's going to also be healthier for you because it's going to keep you from talking about your drama to constantly to so many different people. So we talk about, I talk about in the book, the need to find that right sound and board as well as having the right professional support a\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003end limit the conversations with everybody else.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSuper helpful and very, it's also like it sounds obvious, but when you're going through it, I think like people do want to help, but they don't know how to, we do want to vent and dump, but sometimes we don't want their advice, you know, so even something as simple as like, Hey, I just need to bitch and moan for five minutes. I really don't even want advice, but if you could listen to it, like things that we might expect people to understand, I feel like as guys, we need to \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003earticulate and say, this is what I need. This is what I don't need. And it takes like, you know, it takes getting punched in the face a few times till you realize that and say like, I feel worse now after this conversation. So very helpful tips. And I'd also say like, you're not going to meet that Hans the first time I remember going out for I think guys, I tended to date a lot right away because I wanted the connection. And I've actually found it harder to find guys to relate to, which is probably what I needed more.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut like, you will also come across a lot of, it sounds bad to say, but toxic divorce people. And I would be like, oh, I'm in a more positive state than them. So maybe while they want to go, they're the only one that will go have a beer with me, they're not helping me either. it's like, it's almost like dating where you're like, you're a new person in my life. I mean, look, for when you're married, you probably have the same friends for 25 years. And like all of sudden now you're recreating. So, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ethese are really helpful things that are like not obvious at first and you got to like, you know, step on some landmines, but really helpful to hear of like how to cultivate a healthier, you know, connections with people.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, one of the four sections in my book deals with basically, I'm going to use the words self-care, things that you can do to be kind to yourself that can make the path easier for yourself. Many of us like, well, it's all about my kids. It's all about my kids. It is, but this is a very big, but the less healthy you are, the more ineffective you are as a parent. So it's symbiotic.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's absolutely symbiotic. A better place you can put yourself in, the more capable you will be as a mother or as a father. it is focusing on self-care is gonna also be a massive gift for your children.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eTotally. And that's something I know as parents, especially we put ourselves last and it's like a, it's a weird thing where like, I can't even say in my day to day life, it's like, I've got three kids I'm on as a parent and you're more on because you're a hundred, even if it's half the time, you're a hundred percent parent. And then all of sudden it falls on you and you might not have the healthiest thing. So, so right. That's self care.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eEven if it is like dad needs to go take a walk around the block for 10 minutes, things that you wouldn't have needed to do maybe in your marriage. I really, you know, simple, not easy, but that self care is like, is so important for somebody, especially in that first year or two after divorce. Let's end on one thing, somebody listening right now, they're stuck in the middle of a really messy divorce. What is like, is there one move or one \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003estep that they could take to maybe put them on a better path when they're just, they feel like they're drowning in it. What's one tip you would say to somebody going through that?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eOne tip, well everybody's situation can be so different. One thing I would say to everybody is divorce is a marathon, not a sprint. Okay. So sometimes it does take a bit longer, unfortunately. All right. And also sometimes we really can't communicate with our ex, which that makes it really, really, really difficult.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo if you're in a place where, and I'm assuming that stuck part means you're kind of in the middle of a lot of legal crap, okay? If you still have the line of communication with your ex, and if you don't, do this through the attorneys. Ask an open-ended question, okay? Something that is also not critical of your ex. If you criticize her or him, t\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ehe result is going to be defensive. So something like this, hey, Rob, you and I are breaking up, all right? And we have minor communication, mainly through attorneys. I send you a nicey nice email, say, hey, Rob, we can't be enjoying those last few months. I'm sure you're as stressed as I am. What can we do together?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWe were married for a while. We were raising these amazing kids. What can we do to bring this to a conclusion in the next 30 to 60 days so that we can both move on with our lives? It's not critical. It's extremely honest. It's an open-ended question. And you're empowering your ex to kind of vent and say, come up with a solution.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eOne of the things I talk about in the book is there is a time in divorce where whatever comes out of your mouth, in many divorces, whatever comes out of your mouth, your ex is gonna say, object to. So therefore, stop offering the suggestions. Ask open-ended questions. Define the problem. And this is actually a business skill brought into divorce. Define the problem and go to \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eyour ex and say, we're both having this problem. What do you suggest? Very often your partner's suggestion will be somewhat close to what you want anyhow. And actually in the book, there's a whole chapter about how to take that first answer that comes out of his or her mouth and massage that closer to what you want to have your solution anyhow. So that's one, if you're, if you are stuck, take an action \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ewith your ex to try to get unstuck, it won't always work Rob. And sometimes people just love the conflict. And again, there's chapters in the book that deal with that, but most people would like to see that end and move on. Okay? So anyhow, that's one suggestion I hope in some cases that can help a lot of our listeners.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI love that. And I love how you it's very thoughtful the way you constructed the question you started with a little empathy, like we are not having fun. This must be brutal for you. I know it's, you know, you're starting with empathy, and then you're ending with like, and do you have a thought like giving empowering them and it's especially when we're going through divorce, it's like the exact opposite how we're emotionally want to speak where we're criticizing. So that is super helpful just being a little more \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ethoughtful, strategic even, like a business, in how you're communicating, Awesome.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's strategic. Yeah. And I'll finish with, that chapter that deals with that. We go a lot deeper and this is, these are business skills brought into divorce communication. So let's say your answer. There's 10 % of that, that I like and 90 % that, Rob is back to his old tricks. Okay. So my answer to your answer, like, I really love this focusing on the 10 % we're aligned with.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI still think we have a, a challenge. What do you think about this? Not even talking about the part that was in there, just, that was all pissy. And then what tends to happen guys is that 10 % that you're aligned with expands a bit and ends somewhere between 40 and a hundred percent. You say, thank you so much, Rob. We are in alignment. Are you okay that we send this to the attorneys? Let's wrap this up.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd you can move on with your life and I can move on with mine. But it's very often not a one email or one text thing or a one conversation. You got to go, you got to play ping pong three or four times. And then you focus only on the parts of the response that can be a foundation for an agreement. Ignore everything else. And you keep putting it to your ex to expand on that 10%. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd this is a business skill guys that is so effective in divorce communications. That's why it's an entire chapter in the book.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003elove that. I love that you like take this emotionally charged thing and it really is. mean, every lawyer says treat it like a business, but like we can hear that. like hearing it from somebody that's been through it, who is a businessman? I think it's a really unique angle. Andy, let people know where they can pick up the book.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eAndy: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSure, everybody, go to amazon.com and just write \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B072FNSLKR/about\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eAndy Heller\\u003c/a\\u003e, H-E-L-L-E-R, take the high road, the book will pop up and you can reach out to me.

Today we are lucky to be joined by Nick Himonitis. Nick is a lawyer, a private investigator, a digital forensics expert who spent over 30 years uncovering the truth in high stakes cases from financial fraud to complex divorces.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Nick and I are gonna be talking about hidden assets and forensic investigations. Nick, thank you for being on today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas\\u003c/strong\\u003e: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eLet's just jump right into it with the questions here. When it comes to finding hidden assets, especially in a divorce, you always hear about forensic accountants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is an example of like digital forensics? What kind of things are you looking for?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSure, forensic accountants do a lot of things. Mostly what they do is examine information that people already have about financial accounts and financial transactions, right? To find if there are gaps in the documents and information, if there appear to be transactions that aren't really fully explained and they need further explanation of what those things represent. They mostly focus on examining the known universe of financial information, right? What we do as financial investigators and the digital forensics component is really a means to an end in this regard is to focus on the unknown, the unseen, right? What may be out there that the parties don't have to give to the forensic accountants to analyze or examine and opine about, right? Come up with values, et cetera, et cetera.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for example, in divorce cases, which is certainly by no means all, but a big part of the work we do, there may be a moneyed spouse, right, who may own a business and the forensic accountants have personal financial records and bank statements and bank statements and financial records about the business and they're doing their thing and going through all that. We will often get brought in in a case like that where someone thinks or has reason to suspect that maybe the moneyed spouse has a whole other business that they don't have any details about, or they don't have any records about to give to the forensic accountants, or that the moneyed spouse has other assets that they don't have records or information about to give to the forensic accounts. So generally what I'm saying is, know, forensic accountants, for the most part, at least in my experience, which is pretty extensive, you know, they're not out there researching and investigating and running around the world looking for what they don't know about. They're focused on what we do know about.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo a big part of our job, at least in the financial due diligence that goes on in divorce cases, is to try and close that gap and go out there and see what else may be out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I could be a lot of things and has proven out over the years to be a lot of different things in a lot of different cases, from real estate to whole other businesses that were owned that no one knew about, to offshore investments, to very, very prevalent in recent years, cryptocurrency holdings that people didn't disclose or parties didn't know about, et cetera.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eMaybe another family they've got that you never even knew about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas:\\u003c/strong\\u003e We have indeed seen that too, although I'm not sure I'd put that in the category of an undisclosed asset as much as usually a liability. But yes, we certainly have seen those cases. That's a real thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e So it sounds like they're going after the known, you guys are digging into the unknown. You're finding the hidden treasure that there might not be out there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eGenerally speaking, yeah, that's pretty much what separates us, you know, or differentiates what we're doing from what forensic accounts are usually doing, yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e So for somebody listening that's either going through a divorce or even a lawyer listening that suspects something, there, what's an example of a red flag that might be an indicator that somebody is hiding something?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas:\\u003c/strong\\u003e That's a great question. you know, there can be a lot of red flags. And this is something where I'll actually take a cue from the forensic accountants, right? Because they'll be the first ones to say this. The biggest red flag is if the expenses, right, of the couple, right, we're talking about divorce cases, right? So there's a family.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the expenses of the family are clearly in excess of what the income appears to be on paper, well, right off the bat, unless there's a steadily increasing debt that's visible and easily documented, where's the difference coming from? It's coming from somewhere, right? Some source of cash income or some other source of income that is not known about or not clearly visible in the financial picture. That's one major big red flag. The other things I would say, that's like a big picture red flag. On a more micro level, like for a client, usually it's things like the client heard something, heard the other spouse mentioning a business or mentioning an address or mentioning something that might represent an investment or something that they had never heard of before. And again, very, very prevalent in recent years, maybe one spouse heard the other spouse say something or mentioned something having to do with cryptocurrency and everyone's looking at the financial disclosures in the case and there's no reference to any cryptocurrency accounts or crypto assets, well that's a huge red flag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yeah, I imagine these are the kind of things too that like when you're married, you're like, he's got his own thing. it all works. It's all like part of the family thing. And we're kind of okay with it or return a blind eye. But then when we're getting divorced, all of a sudden, this is a new problem. And this is something we have to address. Is that something that you see with clients?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas:\\u003c/strong\\u003e All the time. that kind of, the question is great because it kind of dovetails into a little story or example I like to give because, you when I have chats like this, folks usually ask like, give me an example of like, you know, some really big find that you made or something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this goes right along with the question you asked, which is, so yeah, all the time we get involved in cases, especially, you know, like we said divorce cases where our client may or often is not the moneyed spouse and much more than that sometimes is, I want to say financially ignorant. And I don't mean in a general sense. mean, they're ignorant of all the facts and details of the family's finances. And they've been more than happy to be that way because everything was fine for however long things were fined for, but now they're not. And we have a client who just doesn't know very much or doesn't think they do.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we had a case just a couple of years ago and to this day, was one of our biggest crypto fines of an undisclosed asset in a matrimonial case. And it was with a client who was completely financially ignorant of the details of the marital finances. So was a high net worth case. And we got into the case, were multiple lawyers representing our client, a team of forensic accountants working with our client, going through the husband's business, financials and all this other stuff. The client kept saying, I know my husband's got a bunch of crypto stuff. Like that's about how sophisticated she was with respect to crypto.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe's like, but I don't know anything about it. I don't know where it is or what kind, and I don't know anything about that stuff. And we were asking the lawyers and the forensic accounts, and we're looking at all these things and everything. eventually we're pouring through documents and stuff, and we find a Coinbase statement, right? Coinbase is probably the most well-known cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. And we look at it, we're like, aha.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then we very quickly looked at the account information. She said, wait a minute, this is not the husband's account. This is our client's account. So we went and asked our client. We said, there's a Coinbase statement here. She goes, yeah, that. She goes, I didn't do that. My daughter set that up for me. I don't know anything about it. We said, but then we kept asking questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she eventually says, well, my daughter set that up for me a few years ago, before all this divorce stuff happened, because she said, my husband wanted to give me some crypto for my birthday. Well, what's your birthday? She tells us her birthday. We look on her Coinbase statement that only has a couple of dozen transactions on the whole account. And there's not very much value in there. keep in mind, again, this was a high net worth case. Maybe there was $50,000 or $100,000 worth of crypto in it, which in the context of this case was not a lot of money. But we looked on her birthday and there was an incoming transaction on her birthday. So we traced it to a private non-custodial wallet. And then we examined all of the transactions out of that wallet. And we traced that wallet to some other wallets. And we ultimately wound up uncovering a flow of crypto funds from what was clearly the husband's private non-custodial wallets to a little known, not very popular cryptocurrency exchange located in the Midwest of the United States that, know, 999 out of a thousand people, even crypto people never heard of before. And that flow of crypto over period of a few years leading up to and after the divorce, totaled around $15 million worth of cryptocurrency that had been funneled to this crypto account. And it wasn't disclosed anywhere in the financials of the case. So, hello.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy point is, yes, we deal with clients who are ignorant of the financial details and circumstances in a marriage very often. But we never make the mistake of discounting, you know, what they may know without even realizing they know it, you know. And we always make a point of talking to them repeatedly sometimes, and really, you know, drilling them. you know, sometimes, yeah, it's like pulling to my wife's a dentist. And I always joke with them, like I pull teeth too, but in a different way. And we try and get to the bottom of it any way we can.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eOh, and it's such an interesting topic because a lot of these a lot of people got involved in crypto when it was very new. So maybe they said, Oh, I got 100 shares, parts of Bitcoin when it was 100 bucks. And back then, it was worth that 10,000 bucks. now, unbeknownst to maybe the spouse, that $10,000 could be $10 million. Is that something you see a lot where it's like, it started as like a lark, and now it's a real thing?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yes. Yes. And I'll tell you something else about that that's really important when we talk about crypto and hidden assets and stuff. And by the way, mean, last I looked yesterday, I may be off a little, but Bitcoin is up about over all time, I don't know, 121,000% or something like that. Find me a stock or a fund that's up 121,000%. So yeah, when we do investigations and there's a suspicion of cryptocurrency holdings or assets, one of the things we're looking for, like I mentioned in the previous case, we got to get a starting point to do an investigation or forensics, right? It's not like, if we're looking for hidden bank accounts, we have methodologies available to us where if I know your name, I can find your social security number, I got your date of birth, I know some other basic information about you, there are legal, lawful legitimate ways that we can not get your private banking information like the details of your banking transactions, et cetera, because nobody can do that legally, you know, outside of subpoenas and compulsory legal process.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we have lawful ways that we can do research to identify financial institutions at which it is likely that you or at some point in recent past had accounts or you had some dealings with these institutions. We can do that based on you, your name and personal information. You can't do that with cryptocurrency except with the brokerages and exchanges. Coinbase, Kraken, the whole list of brokerages and exchanges, the crypto platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are more or less like banks for this purpose. You can subpoena them. You can find out whether somebody has an account there and if so, you can get the account records, et cetera, just like you can from Chase or Citibank through legal process. We even have ways to find out without subpoenas or compulsory legal process, just like we do with the bank accounts and investment accounts, whether John Jones has an account or appears to have an account at Coinbase or Kraken or Robinhood or etc. But that's all we can find out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the whole other half of the crypto universe, okay, the crypto universe for this purpose is split in two. There's what we call the custodial crypto universe, which is what I was just talking about, the Coinbases and Krakens and Robinhoods of the world, which is what a lot of people do. And pretty much most people, if not everyone who has no nefarious ulterior motives does that, right? But the whole other half, and when I say half, it's at least half, if not more, of the crypto universe is what's called the non-custodial or peer-to-peer crypto universe, which is, I got a whole bunch of crypto. None of it is in any cryptocurrency brokerage or exchange or account anywhere. It's all in self custody, private non-custodial wallets that I created, I set up without any help or involvement of anybody else in the world and nobody in the world knows that it's mine except me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ledgers and the treasurers, the hardware wallets where you see in the movies and TV, somebody's waving around a thing that looks like a thumb drive and they're like, I've got the 5 million in crypto right on here. That's what we're talking about, non-custodial crypto. And that's a huge and very real thing. And I know I seem like I went a little afar, but it's a weave. And I'm coming right back to your question now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe've had plenty of cases where someone was an early adopter in crypto. They got a bunch of Bitcoin from, let's say, mining, back when individuals could actually mine crypto on their own and once in a while be successful and win some Bitcoin mining rewards. Can't do that anymore. You have to basically be like a server farm in China to successfully mine any Bitcoin. So they got some Bitcoin back in 2016 or 2015, right? Before most of the rest of the world even knew what Bitcoin was. And they got it in a private non-custodial wallet. They never put it on an exchange or brokerage. And they still have it to this day on that private non-custodial wallet. Well, they sent it to a new private non-custodial wallet, maybe the 10th new private non-custodial wallet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it's never touched a brokerage or exchange because they've never cashed it out. And they had it since 2015. And now it's worth, you know, 100,000 % of what it was worth when they got it in 2014 or 2015. And yes, we've had a few cases where one spouse, you know, got 10 or 20 or 30 or what have you Bitcoin back in the day and they still had it now. I mean, Bitcoin's at like $123,000 now, but even six months ago, whatever, it 90 or $100,000? You're talking about tremendous, tremendous value. And in those cases, if we don't have a lead or a hook somewhere to lead us to the existence of that crypto, there's no way to find it and attribute it to the person we're investigating just by virtue of the person's name, social security number, because none of that exists or has any relevance in the crypto universe, except that the brokerages and exchanges, which operate like financial institutions. And they, of course, require all that information, just like a bank does. That's what makes the whole crypto revolution, especially in this context, so game changing and so fundamentally different, because it's literally created something that has never been seen before. The ability to create your own account, to hold and transact assets without the involvement of any financial institution anywhere. So nobody has any record of who you are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e It's almost like a, it's like a brand new problem that nobody, until they contact Nick and the NGH group, like they had no way of even knowing this was a problem, forget finding a solution. So it's like, this really didn't even exist until whatever, 10 years ago when it started.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, mean, so Bitcoin's been technically around since 2011, 2012, you know, as a real thing, a little earlier than that, if you want to get really technical, but yeah, until we only got really seriously involved in crypto and blockchain forensics, in 2017, 2018, because we saw this look many years ago, I saw digital forensics as the turning point, next really big thing in financial investigations. I was already involved in doing financial investigations back before digital forensics was even really an actual term.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then jump ahead, 25 years or so back in 2017 or so, I'm sitting around, I'm reading bits and pieces about crypto and Bitcoin and reading up more and more about it from a practical and technical point of view. And the light bulb just went off and I said, this is gonna be huge. And I didn't mean it in a way the economists and investment people mean, this is gonna be huge. Although I guess I kind of realized that, although I guess I didn't realize it that much or we wouldn't be talking. I'd be on my mega yacht in the Caribbean, right? But I certainly realized that in the context we're discussing, this was gonna be a huge thing. And it has very much turned out to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eEspecially I imagine for high net worth individuals and assets, they're looking for places where can I store my money? What if I get divorced? Like they're thinking about all these things. And usually it is only one person of the two that's handling the money in general. So I could imagine even more so. Are there people that are out there like, helping the high net worth individual? Here's a place like the Swiss bank account? Is this like kind of another angle for that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYes. Well, so here's the thing. The answer is sure, yes, there are, but maybe not in the way you meant it, because if you were, you know, the moneyed spouse in some high net worth marriage, and you know divorce is coming down the pike, not too many years ago, you said, well, I gotta put this $50 million somewhere on the side. And you wanted to, put it in a Swiss bank account, let's say, right? Yeah, you needed people to help you do that, starting with the Swiss banker and probably three or four intermediary people to assist you in the process. And it was complicated and costly, by the way, you know, the Swiss bankers don't take and hide your money on the cheap, you know? So the whole point with the crypto is this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I'm that guy now, I can put 50 million into crypto. Little footnote, okay, yeah, there's this issue of how do I take the 50 million US dollars and convert it to crypto? That's a whole different discussion. If I'm trying to do that and not leave a clear, easy to follow trail, but there are ways people do that or attempt to do that that make it hard to follow. But once I've got the crypto, now I can put 50 million or 500 million on that ledger nano just as easily as I can put 50 bucks. And then it's right here in the palm of my hand. And I can get on a plane and go anywhere in the world with my $50 million. I don't need a suitcase full of cash. I don't need a box full of gold bricks. You know, I don't need something that's hard to get through customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd technically speaking, I don't even really need that ledger nano in my hand. All I need is the 24 word seed phrase for that ledger nano, and I don't even physically need that ledger nano and that money's mine. And I have to stress how serious I mean that when I say, that money's mine. Because what I mean there is this, if you've got $50 million in a bank account, I don't care what bank it's in, including a Swiss bank, okay? Of course, it's much harder to reach if it's in a Swiss bank, but it's still reachable. And some court can still exercise jurisdiction over it. Even if there's big international stuff and they gotta go to Switzerland, don't.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, I'm not an expert in that. But certainly if it's in any US bank or any bank that does business in the US, a court can exercise jurisdiction over that and send an order to the bank and say, freeze this account, because the court says so. If I got $50 million in a private non-custodial crypto wallet, you could get an order from the United States Supreme Court that literally says, freeze all the crypto in Bitcoin wallet number BC1Q, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And give me that order. It's nothing to do with it. It's not worth the paper it's printed on because there's no one to serve it on. There's no bank. There's no central Bitcoin controlling authority. It's an autonomous blockchain that operates organically that controls all the transactions and code is law. If you have the private key to that wallet with the $50 million of Bitcoin in it, you and only you direct what happens to it. No one can freeze it. No one can take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one can stop you from transferring it as a physical matter. That's what makes this so fundamentally different. There's never been anything like this before. Other than cash or gold bricks, you know, which are incredibly hard to hide and move around. And that's what's like really flipped everything on its ear and makes this so, you know, fundamentally different.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e And it's not going anywhere. I think a lot of people thought, oh, this was a fad. Just like maybe they think AI is a fad. Maybe like they thought the internet was a fad 30 years ago. It's like, this is a new reality. And think about like how many 30 year olds that got involved in this when they were 21. Now they're married. They're probably not saving in gold and old bank accounts. They actually probably have a lot of money. So I can only imagine this is going, we're like in the infancy of this whole world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThere is no question in my mind and I've been fielding this question for years. And I'll be honest with you, in 2017, 2018, 2019, when people asked this question like, oh, you know, is this here to stay? Is this gonna go away? My answer was, nah, I think this is really here to stay. That's not a question anymore. That ship sailed long time ago. This is here to stay now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to any one specific cryptocurrency token, right? You know, who knows? Bitcoin's at $123,000 for all I know, six months from now, maybe back down to 10 grand. Not likely, you know, but I'm not an expert in cryptocurrency economics. Just cryptocurrency, I know how to find it and trace it. Don't ask me if it's going up or down. I don't know any more than anybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as a whole, it is absolutely positively not going anywhere. There's too many, we're talking about, because it's the nature of our conversation, the nefarious and underhanded ways it comes into play. There are way too many very legitimate, very constructive and very positive uses, where cryptocurrency has really solved a lot of problems and issues. It's not going anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eMan, I hear all this. There's somebody out there that's thinking, damn it, Nick. Like, who is this guy coming in? He's ruining my whole party here. You probably have a lot of people that might not be the biggest fan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas:\\u003c/strong\\u003e We certainly have a growing list of not fan clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is an important discussion because I can even our listeners probably their eyes glaze over this is too complicated. and when it comes to a divorce, like these are the assets that you know, they were part of your merit marital assets. So it is important. And I think the whole point of this is like, this is too overwhelming to do on your own your law. This is above your lawyer's pay grade. It's like, this is the reason why you need an expert that specializes in this. So that's why I'm glad we're having this conversation today.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, and you hit the nail right on the head there. The smartest lawyers are the ones who call us and say, hey, I know what cryptocurrency is, but I don't know nearly enough about this stuff. I need you guys. And to be honest with you, I know some really, really bright, some brilliant forensic accounts. And a lot of them call us and say, hey, we're really good forensic accounts, but we can't do this crypto forensic stuff like you guys are doing, we need your help. So we actually wind up working hand in hand with lot of forensic accountants on cases that involve cryptocurrency issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSuper interesting. Well, let's leave it on that. Let's let people know where they can connect with you, Nick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYou can check us out at our website, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://thenghgroup.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eTheNGHGroup.com\\u003c/a\\u003e. You can call our office anytime, 516-621-6500. As for me, I'm always happy to talk to anybody who wants to chat about these things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eI love it. Yeah, after this conversation, I'm sure the phones will be ringing of I suspect something's going on here. I had no idea how big it was, though. Thank you, Nick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eNicholas: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo you're very welcome. Thanks.

And it actually, can happen during the divorce process as well. But it takes some time to really accept the fact that you're going through this. And once you stop resisting and trying to question the why, the how, what was done to me or what did I do to contribute to this? Once you accept it, you're ready to move on at that point, then that's when the healing starts.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou know, and I'll speak of my own experience. You know, we were going through a process, you know, contemplating divorce and going through the divorce over three years. And the first couple of years, I was the victim. And I, you know, it became my new identity, a divorced dad going through divorce. It's all I thought about. And my mind would spiral over and over again. And it wasn't until I actually met a divorce coach who really helped me \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ethink through this and really see, you know, there's some great opportunities for growth here and that whether I like it or not, I need to accept the new reality that yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and all I have is the now. So, you know, there's a big shift in identity. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo once you can realize that there will be a new version of me, there will be a new normal and what so many people try and do is they try and return to their normal.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, their normal obviously wasn't working, but here's a real great opportunity to figure out what does your new normal look like. And you're getting off the hamster wheel of life and you're standing there and you're taking a look at your life, your surroundings, your relationships, your love life, your self, and you really have a great opportunity to make adjustments so that your post-divorce life can really be incredible.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo much good stuff in there that I haven't gone through my own divorce I can relate to. It's like that that term resistance I always I almost like at a certain point, especially with young kids. It's like, resistance is futile. Like it just does not work. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut I wonder, like with hindsight, we can see that but do think you can you can skip that part? Can you skip that thrashing painful chaos when you're going through divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou can certainly skip it and lots of people do, but then they're stuck in a negative spiral. And one of the reasons that I became a divorce coach, which never in my life did I ever expect this would be kind of my pathway, you know, I made some new friends and I started building this new community and I had some new divorced friends who five, 10 years out, they were still stuck. In fact, I know one person who 25 years out is still kind of stuck \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ein the divorce and that being a big part of her identity. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo yes, you can move through it. It's just a process. But really you want to grow from it. And if you don't do the work and you don't do the introspection, you're cheating yourself. You're cheating your kids. You're cheating your family and you're cheating the world of what you can become the better version of you or what I like to refer to as the you 2.0.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, and I think we all go through it's I almost call it like a divorce honeymoon. Whereas right after you're like, you got the adrenaline, it's over, you're like, I'm through it, I'm gonna go date or party or take time to myself. And then a lot of it's not a linear thing. A lot of times you go up and then you crash down and then you sit in it. So it seems like it's not a linear process divorce.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt really isn't. And you know, we spend a lot of time blaming ourselves and you know, we certainly have contributed to the failure of a marriage. But it's also really important to learn about, you know, why do I act the way I act? You know, what sort of, you know, childhood trauma or life trauma do I have and how can I work through that? And then also conversely with with your ex and I'm not saying this in a bad way.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut really trying to understand who are they and why do they act and did they act a certain way? And then maybe did I not understand it? Did I not respond to them? And ultimately, I think this is the solution to a lot of problems in our life. It's early communication. It's getting to understand one another. And in future relationships, I really took this into perspective. You know, I'm, happy to announce I actually got engaged last night to a wonderful woman who I've been dating for two years.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWe both did the work and we've had the conversation and I feel really good about our relationships because I understand everything about her, you know, that she's shown me and she understands everything about me that I was willing to show her and I think because, you know, we were so vulnerable with one another and we're so empathetic and understanding, I think our relationship is gonna really thrive because of that.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I think that's often one of the things that leads to marriage is just not full transparency or willingness or want to learn about people's past and what fully makes them tick, not just on the positive side, but on the negative side.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat and the fact we're probably 25 and not, our brains aren't fully evolved and we just want to have kids. There's all kinds of like a recipe that leads to, and when I look back, I'm like, well, no shit. These people are getting divorced because like they're going into this business with like blinders on. So, you know, and our kids come from it. So there's so many great things that come from our marriage and look, you're new, you your engagement. Do even think that would have been possible \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ewithout having gone through what you went through?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAbsolutely not. You know, this wonderful relationship that I'm in would never have been possible without going through the divorce because frankly, I didn't do the work. I didn't do the introspection. I didn't really understand what made me tick and what made others tick and it opened up my eyes and you know, I'm grateful for that. And I also didn't really, I didn't realize what happiness and joy was. Now, I had a great relationship with my ex until we didn't in terms of our marriage.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut we were young and we were dumb and like you said, you know, our brains aren't fully formed and lived experience goes a long way. And, you know, we just have to take that information and really process it and use it in our future decisions or future actions and such and be very deliberate. And listen, marriage is hard. Parenting is hard. It takes time. It takes investment and you can't just let it be. If you let it be, it's going to fail.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I think that's probably something that we did in our marriage. just, were on the roller coaster of life, you know, had three kids and, you know, lived through COVID and social injustice and on, you know, being business partners. And, you know, we never really took the time to work on ourselves as a couple. So, you know, it takes work.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, well, it's and it's, it's a very ambitious undertaking, you know, raising three kids going through, you know, it's just like, I think, having that clarity, and it is was kind of one of the questions I was going to ask you is a divorce can be this opportunity, it can be painful, but it can be this opportunity to rebuild your life. Is that what you're you're seeing here?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, so, you know, divorce can definitely be an opportunity to rebuild your life. But I think you have to do divorce right. And what that means is, you know, while you're going through the divorce, you know, it's not necessarily about 50-50. It's about making each other whole. It's about having a good, strong co-parenting plan if you have kids so that your kids thrive, because it's not divorce that destroys kids. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's a bad divorce and bad co-parenting \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ethat destroys kids. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I will say, while we didn't have a very nice or amicable divorce, I give my ex-wife and I a lot of credit for saying, hey, our kids really matter. We need to be the best possible co-parents that we can be. And I give us an A plus on that. We're excelling in that because we realize how important our kids are. And a lot of my clients, when they come to me, they have co-parenting \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eissues and problems and we work on that so that it can be harmonious. You're not meant to be best friends, but you and your ex, if you have kids, you're gonna be in business with the kids for the rest of your lives. So you want it to be a positive experience, not just for the two of you, but obviously for your kids, because if they see you getting along well, then they're gonna thrive in life. If they see there's a lot of problems and they're being dragged into it, they're gonna suffer \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eand that's not something that we as parents should ever do to our kids.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, it's so interesting always here like divorce can have this really negative impact on kids. And we all skip the part that like maybe the healthy marriage, the unhealthy marriage also might have a negative impact on kids. And then it's like, the reason we get divorced is to have a healthier model for our kids. So while it takes time, like the goal of divorce is to model a healthier relationship, so our kids can benefit not just keep repeating this pattern in just a different container.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, absolutely. And to go back to your original question, you know, it takes a lot of introspection. And I don't want to glamorize divorce because it's not a great place to be. But sometimes we're in it. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut let's not let a divorce go to waste. It's a perfect time to really dig deep and find out what makes us tick, what gets us excited. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd this is all aspects of our life. You know, what are we grateful for? Our career? Do we want to make a career change or \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003efinancial, our identity, who are we, who do we want to be? What sort of legacy do we want to leave behind? Connection with a greater power, know, am I spiritual, am I connected to God, I connected to something else, but it's a great way to, you know, connect to something else. Your support network, your community, your hobbies, you know, it's really interesting. There were a couple things that, you know, I kind of challenged myself during the divorce t\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ehat I would have never done when I was married. Number one is I took ballroom dancing lessons. you know, I remember when my ex-wife and I started practicing for our wedding dance, you know, the teacher and she both said, you got two left feet, you know, this isn't going to work out. So we changed the structure of the dance. So I always thought that I wasn't going to be able to be a dancer. So I challenged myself.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I took lessons and I competed in A, dancing with the stars, you know, competition, you know, for charity. And the other one was, you know, I've always been interested in fitness, but I did it very recreational and I wanted to do something a little more. So I started training as a triathlete and I've done a handful of triathlons and I have a few more in the future, but I never thought that was possible. And not only was it great because I was taking care of my body.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut the connection between the mind, body, spirit and soul was so powerful. And guess what? I had a new community of friends. And that's really important. And when you're going through a divorce, you need a community. You need multiple communities. You need a support network and that helps you get through it. you know, looking back at who I am today versus maybe who I was five years ago, I'm much happier as a person. I feel a lot more fulfilled. And even though I'm not happy I was in this position, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI think deep down it was probably a blessing and the second part of my life I feel is on the up and up.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAbsolutely. And that's a great point. I hadn't even thought about it. It's the isolation I find, especially for guys is like a real, you know, pitfall that comes with divorce. And you're kind of are, you're getting into fitness, you're getting into these other activities, you're like stacking that with community and friendships. So it's like, you're getting this multiple benefits from these new activities that you would have never tried. Maybe you had the same friends for 20 years when you were married, and then you get \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003edivorced and now who are you going to be friends with? It's hard to make friends. So you start dating and then you get into activities that have groups. So I like how you're you're leveraging these life changes to benefit your life in multiple ways.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah. You know, listen, divorce can be really lonely. especially if you're going through it by yourself, but there are some amazing, you know, support networks out there. There's some wonderful Facebook groups, there's hiking groups, there's, you know, you can even, and you should get involved in things that have nothing to do with divorce that just give you joy, whether it's a triathlon or, you know, a fishing club or boating or whatever. There's so many wonderful things to do. And, know, m\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ey ex and I, have 50-50 custody. And what that means is 50 % of my time I'm with my kids. When I'm with my kids, I am with my kids and we go deep and we spend a lot of loving time and wonderful time together. But the other 50 % is a gift. And I get to do what I want when I want and I don't have to answer to anyone else but myself. So you get the opportunity to do things that you ordinarily might not have had time.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDo you hear from your married friends? there like a tinge of envy and curiousness about like what's going on with your life? that something you've seen?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, sometimes, you know, one of my, one of my friends, his wife, sent me a text message and she says, stop telling my husband about all the fun and things you're doing. You know, I'm worried he's going to want to get a divorce and, I apologize, but, it's, it's one of those things. Listen, you can get that in marriage and you can get that in divorce too, but, it's really about just being intentional with your life and your decisions. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd one of the hardest things I heard from a therapist, but \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eit actually proved to be true, is put yourself first. So I would always put, you know, my kids and my ex first. And I rarely ever put myself first. And what I learned was if you put yourself first, you're going to show up better for your kids and you're going to show up better for whomever you're in a relationship with and you're going to show up better for the world. So when you're happy and in a good space, it affects your ecosystem in a very positive way.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd conversely, if you're in a negative space, you have the same sort of negative ramifications.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo you've worked, I'm curious, you've worked with male clients, female clients. I only know coming from a guy's point of view, although on our Instagram, we have millions of women that are constantly talking about their perspective. Do you think men and women handle all of this the same way?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAbsolutely not. Men and women do not handle divorce the same way. I think it's very true what they say, men are from Mars, women are from Venus. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI think men really internalize their feelings and they don't necessarily seek help or support. I also think that for men, identity is such a big part of who they are. So their identity as a father, as a spouse, as a provider, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eyou know, really get shattered. And then there's, you know, the financial piece as well. You know, rarely do either party end out, you know, end off much better after divorce financially. Divorce is very expensive. And, you know, instead of combined assets, now you have separate assets. So it's very difficult. And then I think for the women, you know, their identity is also very different. They will seek support a lot more than men, but they handle it different, you know.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI find with my own clients, the female clients are more emotional about the divorce. They're very concerned about, you know, can I afford to go on? How do I juggle everything? Some were homemakers and full-time moms and now they have to go get a job. you know, multiple dimensions in their lives. So they're different problems. And that's why I go back to the, you know, if you can make your, your spouse, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ewhole. And maybe it's a little bit of an imbalance. Number one, it's good for the kids. But number two, you don't have to, you know, stay fighting, you know, over money and time with the kids and all that over time. I think the best outcome of a divorce is that you wish your spouse, you know, good wishes for the future that they find joy and happiness and fulfillment, and they live the life that they want \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eand you deserve the same and that way, you know, it's not an ongoing divorce. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou know, I have some friends who, know, 10 years out, they're still fighting over stuff that could have been resolved. So I think it's really important in post divorce life to come up with an agreement and there's something I do with my clients a lot of what does good co-parenting look like, you know, how do we address questions, you know, i\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ef I have some concerns, how do I raise it, you know, in a safe way? What does communication look like? Because ultimately, you know, we should have respect for our exes. We love them at one point. We have to always remember that things weren't always bad. And there's lots of reasons why there are divorce. But there's a lot of bad will that's out there that we just need to get rid of because it just it holds us back from forward progress and momentum. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd y\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eou know, for some people, can't make big moves. So I always suggest make micro movements, you know, do one small thing every day. And then you'll find out over time that you're making big change. So men and women, I've just always found, handle divorce very differently. You know, my client base is probably split 50 50, but their needs are very different. And, know, one other point on that is I think it's really important for \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ea male to put themselves and understand the mindset and the concerns of a woman and for a woman to put herself in the mindset of a male and what's important to him. And that way, if you can understand each other while you're going through a divorce, hopefully you can resolve all your issues in mediation and not have to go to court. And then when the divorce is completed and just moving forward with each other, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eyou have a good understanding of the other person and it shows respect to one another. And then it's a productive relationship, which really benefits everybody.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, that's, it's, it's so true. see so much of it from hindsight. So that's the really the benefit. And I didn't even know what a divorce coach was when I was going through mine. I now see like the benefit of working with somebody that's been through it. That's not just your lawyer. I know you've got a new book out and let people know how they can connect with you, Justin.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eJustin: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, absolutely. And, you know, I just want to say having a support team is really important. And that includes, you know, a therapist, a divorce coach, an attorney, you know, a CPA. and the list, the list goes on depending on your needs. you know, a divorce coach is very different than a therapist. A divorce coach is your thought partner through the process. You use them for the highest and best use. can use them before \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003efiling for divorce during divorce and post divorce depending on what your needs are. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhereas a therapist really helps you understand your emotions, dig deeper into trauma, you know, but they don't necessarily have the specific experience in divorce. They work great hand in hand. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo I wrote this book, launched it in June. It's called \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://a.co/d/dS8EXAY\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eYou 2.0 Divorce a Better Way Forward\\u003c/a\\u003e. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd so far it's been going really well. And really this was a labor of love. I want people to go through divorce as amicably and as quickly as possible. Typical divorce takes about five years to work through the emotions. I think if you read the book and you get a coach and stuff, you'll move through it in one or two years. And the sooner you move through it, productivity, emotion, emotional wellness, mental health, all that improve. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd then \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI had some requests from my book. They said, this is really helpful, but I'd love to have a workbook. So we created this workbook. We're launching it next week, I think on the 21st of August. And this basically takes the concepts from you 2.0, you know, and gives you exercises that are deeper, greater depth that, that you can go through yourself. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou can always reach me on my mobile phone, 404-\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e353-5175. I give a 30 minute free consultation to talk about your situation. You can also reach us at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://reclaimandreboot.me/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003ewww.reclaimandreboot.me\\u003c/a\\u003e.

Chris is the VP of Business Development at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eSoberLink\\u003c/a\\u003e, helping family law professionals use modern alcohol monitoring to protect kids in custody cases. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eChris, thank you for being here today.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eHey, thanks for having me on, appreciate it.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eOf course, yes, we have, we have spoke before and we see this a lot where alcohol is such a big kind of factor that's not talked about in divorces. So I think anybody that's listening that has gone through it or they, you know, they have drinking problems, their ex has drinking problems. It's a real like visceral emotional feeling. Is that something you see when you talk to a lot of parents that are going through this?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAbsolutely. It's amazing how quickly when there are accusations of abusive drinking, how quickly relationships dissolve or just get in a bad place. And yeah, I see it every single day now.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, and it's one, it's I always say it's one thing when you're married and you're living with it, but that's the thing once people are getting divorced, all of a sudden they don't know what's going on in the other house and you know, the fear of like what is happening with my kids. So I'm excited to talk to you about today about, about sober like and how it really helps with that, that peace of mind.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI agree with that Rob. Yeah, let's get started. Awesome.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAlright, first question we have Chris. What is the biggest mistake people are making when they're trying to prove that they're responsible parent after divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, think the biggest mistake that people use while trying to really prove that they're a responsible parent after divorce is confusing what is real data from like an anecdotal information. And that itself brings a lot more questions. So if you can do something where you're documenting information time in and time out when you're not with your ex anymore, that's really going to help, you know, earn some of that trust back.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd with divorce, it's always a lot of he said, she said, once you get to that point. And if you can have actual data to back things up, it really helps earn that trust back.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo when you say data, that's a lot of what SoberLink helps provide. SoberLink is technology. How does technology help in this going from anecdotal to like real results?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, no, that's great. And I think that going from the end of the day to real data is really important because it changes the whole narrative of the conversation around alcohol abuse. And what is usually a negative stigma can be removed when you have real data. Instead of the questions being from your ex maybe like, did you drink last night or how many drinks did you have? The questions like that are very negative.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut when we change that narrative, because we have real data that sobriety is being documented, we can have more empowering statements like, you know, good work on that testing last week, or, you you did really well last week, keep it up, this is great to see. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSo the conversation changes, and I think the interaction between the two parties really becomes more positive.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI like that you always talk about like, reframing it in a positive light where it's not accusatory. And that's such a common thing in divorce, especially with co parents who even if they're amicable, they just have no transparency as to what's going on. And it seems like sober like kind of just like, you know, pulls the veil away, gives you transparency, and it gives you the ability to be constructive and positive.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI love that word Rob, transparency. That is key. I love that. That's really what we're after in this whole situation. for sure.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWhat is, so people have their probably misconceptions like, a breathalyzer, they get pulled over. What's a common misconception that people have about alcohol monitoring after divorce?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI guess the most common misconception that I see about alcohol monitoring is that I think people don't see alcohol use disorder as a disease. And I think it kind of is taking a step back. know, people are like, it's a moral failing. You know, you don't want to stop drinking to see your kids and you know, Hey, that's not good. You know, well, that's not really the case. Alcohol use disorder is a mental disorder.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYou know, it's diagnosed in the DSM-5. It's one of those things where people need to understand, you know, and even relapse itself when we're actually in the process of monitoring. Relapse is probably going to happen. I mean, the stats say that 70 % of those who are going through recovery are going to relapse, are going to have an episode of relapse. And now with technology like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eSoberLink\\u003c/a\\u003e, we can catch those instances quickly, you know, and then come back and say, okay, well, let's \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003estart over or let's get back on the program and understand what's happening. And as long as we are understanding of that situation, I think that's what's really gonna move the program along. So I think that's an important piece.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, I hadn't even thought about that because like you said, relapse is going, it's just a fact. It's an inevitability and with alcohol and it's a shame to say, you relapse once, you'll never see your kid again because I don't trust you. Is that something you see a lot?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, I see that try to be played out in some orders or parenting plans. And we do a lot of education across the country about how to react to positives and any mistests. And one thing we never want to do is take kiddos away from their parents. We see that a child who is raised by co-parents has a much better success percent in the future.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWe don't wanna see parents being taken away, especially for a disease like alcohol use disorder. So we hope our technology can help empower that individual and get that parent back in that child's life. So that's really a big goal of ours.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI like that. What, I'm putting you on the spot here. Is there one, one powerful, memorable story that you've seen where Soberlink helped reunite a family?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eGosh, you know, I did see one story come through that I really like and it has to do with a little girl. She was probably about 12 to 13 years old, somewhere around there. And she understood her father had a problem with abusing alcohol. And what happened was dad and mom had a very open conversation with the daughter about the problems that were happening.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd they actually introduced the SoberLink device to her so that she could see what is helping dad through this situation. And the conversation went so well that the daughter actually grabbed the device from dad and bedazzled it. I don't know if you're familiar with bedazzling, but put a bunch of charms on it and stuck them on the actual device. And I thought it was really cute to see and hear about because s\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003ehe knew that if dad came with that device and was able to use that on a regular basis, she would be able to have time with her dad, valuable time that is needed for her development. And she was old enough to understand and the conversation was age appropriate, which was great. And I loved it.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI like that story too, because it's coming from a perspective we don't hear as much about is the 12 year old kid's perspective. It's not just like the parents antagonizing each other. You didn't do this. It's like, really, what is this about? It's about the kids. like, I love how like seeing the emotional impact that it can have on the 12 year old daughter that really just wants to spend time with her dad.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat's absolutely correct. You it's about the kiddos at the end of the day.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIf you could tell parents that are going through divorce one thing about trust, what would it be?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eTell a parent one thing about trust. If I could tell them one thing about trust, what would that be? That's an interesting one. And I think really what it comes down to is that trust takes time and it's earned. I once had a psychologist that told me that it takes a couple of years to repair the damage in a relationship, especially from scars of alcohol abuse in the relationship.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eBut when you use technology like SoberLink that gives you real-time data about sobriety, these scars can be mended and repaired much faster. I think that's a key part of good technology being used. So I guess if alcohol monitoring is needed to gain that trust back in a relationship, make sure you're using a system that is trusted amongst attorneys across the country like SoberLink. We use \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003efacial recognition software to confirm identity of each and every test that is taken with our system. And we have internal tamper detection technology that we invest a lot of money in to make sure that each and every test is actually a real breath test and it's not being gamed by the individual. So you can be assured and have peace of mind that, you know, these tests are accurate. So that's really important, but that's the kind of thing, the right technology. H\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eaving real time results documented in which is real data, that's gonna earn the trust back.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eWell, and that's why these conversations and even these clips that we're seeing on social media, it's so important because I feel like a lot of people, do you see it? It's just a lack of awareness that technology like this exists, a lack of education. Is that one thing that you find that like makes people wait too long to even explore technology like SoberLink?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, so why do people wait to explore? And that's a good question for us because our initiative this year is really educate family law attorneys across the country. we actually are putting together education programs that people can sign up for, especially attorneys, to learn more about what we do and how we empower those individuals that are struggling with alcohol use disorder.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eI always ask attorneys to go to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/divorce/family-law-help-center\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003efamily law\\u003c/a\\u003e at soberlink.com to actually sign up for these educational programs. you're right, some of the individuals are like, hey, I don't have a problem. And I think that's one of the issues, is that individuals are still in denial about their issues. I always remember the scenario of when we're together in a marriage, the \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eparents actually use each other as natural monitoring systems when we're out drinking or whatnot, or we're having dinner. But when we're separated, those natural monitoring actually go away. And so it's much easier to have a couple extra drinks when you have no one kind of, you know, regulating your use, right? So that's something that I always see, but I always have to remind individuals that at the end of the day, at the end of the day,\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt's all about those kiddos. It's all about mending the relationship with those kids and making sure that each of the co-parents are part of those kiddos' lives. That's going to lead to the best success. We have to put our, you know, disagreements aside in the relationships that we might have and really make sure we focus on those kiddos.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAnd I like what you brought up there too, a lot of the education actually, well, we'd like to educate parents about this, it almost starts with the lawyers and really getting them to present this option. Because when you're going through divorce, you're in such a fog, you just want to get it done. You don't even know that this is a thing. So it's interesting how like educating the lawyers bringing more awareness to this can benefit their clients.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eChris: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eYeah, that's what we're seeing is that, you know, we're just another tool to their toolkit, right? It's got a lot of toolkits that they can draw from, but when they have a case where their client or opposing counsel's client, you know, is having an issue with alcohol use disorder, we can come in and actually educate both of the attorneys and make sure that we put, you know, the client on the right program to make sure that, you know, it's successful for both parties.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cb\\u003eRob: \\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eRight.

Today we are lucky to be joined by Abbey Flaum. Abbey is a family wealth strategist at HB wealth. After 16 years as an estate planning attorney, Abbey now helps families create smart tax efficient plans around wealth, legacy and life transitions. She is especially passionate about guiding parents through the financial gaps often left in divorce agreements. And today we are talking about clauses parents wish were in their divorce agreements, but often are missing. How's it going today, Abbey?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Great. How are you doing?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eI'm doing very well. As we were talking a little bit before camera, how important and how big of a step that people miss with estate planning and wealth after their divorce. Is that something you see with a lot of clients?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e You bet, and I don't think it's their fault at all. I just think you're balancing so many things and oftentimes there isn't really a quarterback sort of guiding you through all the things you need to think about post divorce, but absolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, remember, it's like, you just want to get it done, you get it done. And then you just want to like collapse into a ball on your couch. And it's like, yeah, I'll get to that later. I'll get to that later. And then three years later, you haven't gotten to it. And that's what we're going to talk about today. Why, why there's still time to do it and why now is important time. But let's talk a little bit about your background real quick. What got you from practicing estate law into becoming a family wealth strategist?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWell, I think I'm one of the few former practicing attorneys you'll ever meet who says, I really loved practicing law. I never thought that I would leave. But then this opportunity arose. HB Wealth approached me to become family wealth strategist, which is really like a consultant for our wealth management clients about all things sort of estate planning. Because I'm not a financial advisor. But when this opportunity arose, after I said no several times I started thinking about it and I realized that this really would afford me the opportunity to dive in deeper with both my clients and my children because I'm a divorcee myself and when you have shared custody of your children you want to make sure that you are devoting yourself 200% to your 50% time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when I left the billable hour, I think that gave our clients at HB Wealth, the feeling of freedom to really dive in deep and talk with me about all of the things that influence their estate planning lives, family dynamics, know, concerns, legacy, the things that oftentimes they feel a little inhibited about talking to their lawyers about because of the billable hour. So I have the luxury of time to dive in deep with them. And I also have the luxury of time to dive in deep with my children and be there for all of the things that I want to be there for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, it's such a gap that I feel like we're missing where we have our lawyer, our diverse lawyer, and they handle this. And then maybe we have somebody that handles our wealth management, or they used to when we were married. And now we're divorced. So are we working with the same wealth manager? And what happens to all these assets? it kind of seems like it gets ignored. And you almost could get away with that when you were married. And it seems like it's something that you just really can't afford to get away with once you get divorced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eAbsolutely, I mean, and oftentimes in a marriage, there's usually one person or the other who's sort of the financial partner that handles all of the financial stuff. At least I hope there is at least one person. But after a divorce, certainly you have to be the quarterback for your own financial life. And whether that means you are thinking of all of the things or you're working with the right people who are thinking of all the things for you. I mean, that's something that you need to figure out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, it's something we always preach that I wish I did more of and now I've learned is like, figure out your team be around people smarter than you. You don't have the bandwidth to do it all. Maybe you could try and pull it off before but now it's like, go find people smarter than you that specialize and work with them because you know, like it's too much for one person to handle and when you're dealing with it all when you're divorced, I feel like it's it's more important than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003e100%. I totally agree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eLet's hop into a couple of these rapid-fire questions. What is the most common clause missing from divorce agreements that parents later regret?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWell, I can say that there's a theme that I've seen a lot, and it's that divorce agreements don't always do a great job of anticipating how the agreements themselves may create conflict. And all too often, I hear from clients and friends that their ex seems more intent on just being contrary than on doing what's right for the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo divorce agreements often need to do a better job of fleshing out what is meant at the time of negotiation than just leaving certain clauses to one's interpretation. And oftentimes the only remedy if someone isn't doing what they're supposed to be doing under the terms of an agreement is to drag them into court and file for contempt. And practically, you know, that's expensive from a financial perspective. It's expensive from a time perspective. And at the end of the day, all it really does is escalate tensions. So if divorce agreements could do a better job of fleshing out exactly what is intended and meant by each provision, hopefully, you know, all the conflict could be avoided and the whole idea of having to go to court and call for contempt could be moved ideally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah. And I'm putting you on the spot here with this. Is there a small example you can think of of something that like, if that small clause was in a divorce agreement, it would have made a big difference to avoid a lot of this expensive conflict?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e I mean, I have a few. One, for example, a common one that I've seen is passport access. Some agreements do a really good job of saying who's going to hold the passports for the children and what the protocol is for requesting the passports and time under which they must be produced. And some agreements don't address passport access at all and leave it to the parents to sort of duke it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother one, I think this is a it seems like a small thing, but it's very common and it can be really big, is that a lot of divorce agreements will divide up breaks, like winter break is divided into two halves. Okay, but it really doesn't specify when the first half ends and the second half begins. If there's an odd number of days, you know, what's the time on the middle day that the children are exchanged and who brings them to who? And if there's an even number of days, how is it divided? Including a provision like that could really eliminate a lot of anger, frustration, nasty texts, and all kinds of heartache.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, and it seems so tedious and like, really, we need to put all this in. But like, in hindsight, it's better to have it set it up, and then use that as a fallback and adjust as needed versus just have it way too loose. And then you have nothing you have nothing to fall back on or to go besides going to a lawyer and maybe going back to court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e And look, you know, I don't want to put too much on divorce attorneys because I will say that while there are lots of conflicts that we could anticipate as humans, you know, you really can't anticipate all of them. You really can't anticipate how unreasonable some people might be. But I will say I've seen a lot of divorce agreements, both in my prior life when I was brought in as a consultant about estate related provisions. And now in my life as a family wealth strategist with clients that want to talk their settlement agreements through. And I can say a lot of them fall short of really fleshing out what they need to, to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eIs that something that people are always coming to you after the divorce is settled? Are you seeing people start to bring in a estate planner, a well strategist, the papers are drafted and before things are signed?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Well, yeah, so our clients, although they all understand that I no longer give out tax or legal advice, I'm really nearly here in a consultative role and they ultimately need to consult with their attorneys. And I think they see me as a legal sounding board resource. And so I am working with many of our company's clients on structuring what might be best for their family in divorce settlement agreements. Because look, the statistics, what they are, about half of all marriages end in divorce. And our clients need that kind of help. We're happy to provide it for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, so important to talk to have your team and talk to them and don't just get in this like echo chamber where it's you and your lawyer and your family telling you what you should do. It's like, talk to professionals and the fact that you've been through divorce, I always find like, very authentic, very relatable to people. Here's here's a mistake I made. Maybe you should talk to your lawyer about adding this provision in or seeing what they think.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e And that's a good lesson and it's a lesson on why you need help because I can tell you that I'm a lawyer with experience in this world and I definitely made mistakes in my own divorce. And that's because when you're in it, it's really hard to take a step back and focus on certain aspects of what it is you're agreeing to. It's definitely good to have an outside party here to help guide you through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWe've kind of talked about this already, but how do you see financial and legal planning overlapping when it comes to protecting the kids after divorce?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e They're really two sides of the same coin. Legal language will create an obligation in a divorce settlement agreement, but the financial planning actually makes it work in real life. I I could agree to something all day long in a settlement agreement, but if I'm not properly planning for it in real life, it doesn't matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, one parent might say that they will be fine to pay for the children's college education. A lot of divorce agreements, by the way, don't address college education because divorce attorneys, if there's a conflict, will say that a judge is not going to mandate what happens after the age of 18. However, a parent might say, yep, I'm happy to pay for college education.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if behind the scenes they aren't doing all of the things that will enable them to afford it, it doesn't matter what that agreement says. If they can't pay for college, they can't pay for college. And then the child, the other parent, everyone's sort of out of luck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e It's such a unique circumstance because all of this is hard enough to save and to organize when you're married and you're on the same page. And then all of a sudden you're single parenting, you've got your own finances. We've talked about before, I usually both people take a hit when they get divorced financially. Nobody's coming out ahead usually. And then you've got college. it's a very just, I always empathize with people how overwhelming it is for anybody listening that's going through divorce that all this now falls on you and you've got to coordinate it with an ex who may or may not be amicable, may or may not have the same interests. yeah, think once again, just building your team, talking to somebody like you and having them in your corner is more important, I feel like in a lot of ways, post-divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, absolutely, I totally agree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e With blended families and modern family structures, what new clauses are becoming essential today?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWell, there's several. mean, families today aren't the families that existed a generation ago even. And there several things to consider. From my perspective within a state planning lens, I'll say many people when they're getting remarried want to ensure maybe that they're providing for their new surviving spouse if something should happen to them if they pass away. But ultimately, most people, when they get remarried, and this doesn't make it right or wrong, but most people feel that they want their assets to ultimately pass for the benefit of their children from a prior marriage or prior relationship. And there are good time-tested ways to structure that. So a lot of times what I'm seeing is clients wanting to put an obligation in the divorce settlement agreement that provides that each of the parents will structure their estates to ultimately provide for the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgia is one of many states where you can make a contract regarding your will and obligate yourself to do something under the terms of your will.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other clauses that I see come into play with blended sort of modern families include clauses about how to introduce a new partner to the children. Timing, you know, under what circumstances are we involved in the other parent or not? And these clauses can be really, really helpful, but they can also cause problems if they're not properly worded. And you have to think about this for yourself. If you're including this clause in an agreement because you're extremely concerned about what your ex is going to do, whether or not you believe it right now, this clause may turn around and bite you, okay, if we're going to structure it so that it applies equally to both parents. You might not foresee that you might meet someone that you're going to want to introduce to the children, but it happens all the time. So it's important to think about that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother one, just to mention this, because this is where we are today, is clauses regarding digital rules. Things like social media boundaries, when the children will have phones, who's gonna pay for those phones, what the parental controls might be. This wasn't a concern 20 years ago, but these days it's fodder for argument frequently. So these are really good kinds of things to contemplate when you're in the throes of negotiation of a divorce settlement agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eI'm sure every generation says, it was harder in my generation. But I contend with all of these different variables and tech and communication we have, we have a lot more balls in the air and factors to juggle than I'm like, what was divorce like 30 years ago and before cell phones? It had to be different on many levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e My gosh, I know. At so many levels, I can't imagine. A divorce attorney who I love here in Atlanta once said to me, if it feels good, don't text it. And I take that advice in life generally. But imagine if texting didn't exist with everything going on in divorce. That would be something.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yes. Right. Write that in a letter and mail it and see how it feels when it arrives. Let's get into a question at least lightly. How does tax planning factor into making divorce agreements truly work long term?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yeah, that's right. Well, I will say this. Unfortunately, I've seen the work of many divorce attorneys and clients who don't understand that a dollar is not always a dollar is not always a dollar. So for example, if you have a cash account worth $100,000 and you have a 401k worth $100,000. Those aren't the same for purposes of division of assets because with the 401k, there's going to be restrictions on how they can be accessed without penalty. And also when they are accessed, unless it's like a Roth 401k, there's going to be income tax consequences for withdrawal of the funds. Whereas a cash account is a cash account. You access it when you want to, and there aren't necessarily going to be any tax ramifications for doing so. So it's important to keep in mind that a dollar is not always equivalent to another dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other examples - dividing retirement accounts requires special orders. And if those aren't drafted correctly, you could face penalties and unexpected taxes from withdrawal from retirement accounts or from dividing them up incorrectly. For divorces finalized before 2019, alimony was usually deductible to the payer and taxable to the recipient. But after 2019, that all changed or if your divorce was modified following 2019 and adopted the new law, alimony was no longer deductible and it no longer was taxable to the recipient. The IRS sort of got out of the alimony business for new divorces. That's something else to keep in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last thing I'll mention is with regard to property transfers, things like this spouse gets the house. Well, OK, much like I said before, a dollar is not a dollar. If the house is worth $500,000, there's likely embedded capital gains within the house value. So if the spouse who receives the house goes to sell that house one day, yes, they may get an upside or a downside with regard to value, but also they may have to pay capital gains taxes as a result of the sale. So there's a lot of taxi sort of considerations relating to divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah. And when I hear it, can remember like when I was going through mine, it's like you take this, you take this, the numbers match up. That sounds good. But in reality, to your point, like some of those numbers for better or worse, they're very different. The 100k may actually be 70k when you deal with the tax consequences. So once again, before signing anything, don't necessarily just trust your divorce lawyer. Talk to, you know, an estate plan or talk to a wealth strategist, get another expert opinion that can like point out like, just so you know what you're signing here. You know, I think that's very important, especially when you're, as we talked about just emotionally overwhelmed and really just want to get it done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, and I want to say, I want to say there's so many divorce attorneys and we have some really, really wonderful divorce attorneys in Atlanta that do all of the things, or in Georgia, that do all of the things you would want to see them do. But I'll also say, and this applies for so many important financial structures that you're implementing in life, it really can't hurt to have more than one expert in the room looking over what you're doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so important, as you said earlier, it's important to have the right financial team sort of looking over your shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Right. And a lot of times you get one shot at this. mean, you can make a difference, but it can be very expensive. So it's like if you're in the ninth inning, like maybe that is the time to pause. And even if you have to bring in somebody just for peace of mind, and even if that costs a little bit of money, it can save you so much time, money, peace of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e All of the things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob:\\u003c/strong\\u003e One last question here. For a newly single parent reviewing their settlement, what's the very first thing that they should check?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWell, of course, I'm a lawyer by training, so it's hard for me to give just one thing. I'll say, I've seen all too often where divorce attorneys are so excellent at being laser focused on getting their clients divorced, but not necessarily as excellent on guiding their clients on the next steps to be taken to implement the provisions of an agreement. So for example, if an agreement says one parent is going to retain what was the marital residence, well, that will require oftentimes a quitclaim deed to be prepared and filed in order to reflect the new ownership. It will also often require that the new sole owner will have to refile for homestead exemption.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think an important thing to do is to look at the agreement and go through it with your attorney and sort of have a list of each and every provision of the agreement that requires some action on your part following the judge signing that order. The other thing I really have to mention, because I can't just give one thing, is obviously a lot of what I do is covered is colored by an estate planning lens.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think a newly divorced parent needs to also ensure that they put proper new estate planning documents in order, a will, revocable trust, advanced directive, and financial power of attorney at a minimum, those four, what I would call four documents, to ensure their estate is structured to pass when they pass the way that they want it to, to ensure that guardians are named pursuant to the provisions of their will in the way that they would want them to be. And also in looking at the estate plan, it's important to look at all titling and beneficiary designations because those can supersede the terms of your will and also your divorce agreement and that can cause an expensive conflict later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eLet me ask you just anecdotally, because I experienced this a lot of people, they're divorced. So it's all on them now. Let's say they do get all of these documents in order. Who does it? Who holds it? Where does it go? Normally, it'd be like, tell your husband or your wife, right? Here's all the documents if something happens to me. What do you tell somebody that's like on their own now? And they get all this done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yeah, there needs to be a trusted person and that person doesn't have to know what your documents say. They don't have to know what your assets are, the values, but they have to know who to contact in the event something happens to you. And hopefully that would be a professional in your life, your lawyer, your CPA, your wealth strategist, your financial advisor, your team who will work with you to have a list of all the assets because this is important to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you pass, there is no sort of database that you can log into that'll tell someone what your assets are and where they are. It used to be back when I started practicing law that if someone didn't know where mom and dad's assets were, they would watch the mailbox and see what statements came, but that doesn't happen anymore. So you need a trusted person to at least know who to contact. And whether you have an individual named as your executor or trustee or you've named a professional trustee at trust company, someone needs to be getting in touch with them to let them know, you know, where all the bodies are buried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, and again, every time we talk about it, you realize like, it's almost it should be a mandatory thing for people going through divorce, like a little bit of training, like, okay, you're to get your divorce license, now you need to go take care of these things. Because before, you could rely on somebody now you do want to make sure these things are, you know, because a lot of this will fall on your kids, and you could end up in probate and all these things that like, is the last thing we want, we want our kids to go through.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I really appreciate this and hopefully this helps people out there listening that are in the process or as we said, already divorced and have been putting this off. Abbey, let people know where they can connect with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbbey:\\u003c/strong\\u003e So, like I said, I'm Family Wealth Strategist at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://homrichberg.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eHB Wealth\\u003c/a\\u003e, and we are located in Atlanta.

Today, we are lucky to be joined by Carla Stern. Carla is a partner at Stern Edlin Graham in Atlanta, and one of Georgia's most respected family law attorneys. Carla is a former president of the state chapter of the AAML. She is board certified and has been named to Best Lawyers in America and Super Lawyers year after year.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarla and I are going to be talking about custody battles, how courts make decisions in the best interest of children. Carla, thank you for being on today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThank you for having me, Rob. Sure. So I've actually been doing this for a long time since 1990, so over 30 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: All right, well, let's get right into it. We'll learn a little bit about your background. You built a career as one of Georgia's top family lawyers. What drew you specifically to family and custody law?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eAnd my father was an attorney, actually my sister is an attorney, so it definitely runs in the family. And I actually did a lot of work in high school for my dad and really kind of was interested in law and litigation. did, he really specialized in family law the last 25 years of his career and it was just a natural fit. So as soon as I graduated from law school, I joined the firm and he has since deceased, so I'm now the Stern of Stern Edlin Graham, but it's just sort of in the blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love family law. I like helping people. I like helping families, and especially when children are involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, we just talked to another attorney and he said he transitioned into family law because he's like, I wanted that human connection. I want to be able to help people and it sounds like family law is unique in that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eDefinitely, and I try a lot of cases. Unfortunately, probably really since COVID, more and more cases have been tried in my experience. And I seem to be trying a lot of contested custody cases. I've tried three in the last three months, which is very unusual. I like to encourage people to resolve their disputes, but I will say going to trial and getting the right result, which thankfully I have had over the last three months. That is very fulfilling as an attorney, as a contested custody lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right, you do hear lot about amicable collaborative, but divorces, there's a wide range of them. Not every case is different and every situation is different. So it's important that we can speak to people that are going through a more contested situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThat's right. The facts are always different. Look, when it's money while people still fight over money and I deal with a lot of big high asset cases with multi, multi-millionaires, and businesses that are being equitably divided. You know, the children are what's most important. So people are going to spend and do and advocate and litigate if they have to when it comes to their children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So let's ask when parents hear best interests of the child, what does that actually mean in practice?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eOkay, so there's a statute dealing with custody and there's a statute that deals with the basically it's the statute says that the judge has to look at what is in the children's best interest. And so, and there's many factors that the judge will consider. There's 12 to 15 in the statute. And so the judge is gonna sort of look at each factor. They're gonna listen to the evidence and the testimony and other witnesses, and they're gonna listen to, and they're gonna kind of hone in on factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFactors can be anything from how well the parties or the parents are familiar with the needs of the children, right? That's one factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they'll also consider, you know, whether or not, and this is probably the most, one of the most important for parents to really think about is whether or not the parent can encourage and facilitate the relationship between the children and the other parent. And that is so important because when you're thinking about litigation, you know, it's high stakes, it's expensive, it's emotional, right? And people get caught up in that. And because of that, sometimes they sort of lose, they lose what's really important and they don't consider the other parent's involvement and relationship with the parent and with the children. And so that's what sometimes really can be the deciding factor when a judge is making decisions about custody.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then there's other factors that there's a custody evaluation where a psychologist is testing and evaluating the parents to determine whether or not they're fit or not. The judge is going to take that into consideration as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And I imagine a lot of clients come in with like, I don't want this parent to ever see the kid. Maybe their expectations are not aligned with the law or reality. Is that something that you have to talk to a lot of people that come in your office?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eAbsolutely. I would say that either it's that extreme where they don't want the other one involved at all, even though remember these people did marry, they did have children together. There's a reason behind it. There may not have been something so awful at that time. What's changed and something may have changed, but there's got to be some dose of reality. And I'm very good at bringing a dose of reality because, you know, the bar is not that in becoming a parent and parenting. And many of our judges see something so much worse than what these parents are complaining about. He doesn't get her up in time. He's never fed her breakfast. He's late to the activity, whatever it is. And unfortunately, that just may be how things will be when the child is with that other parent. But the parent's not going to be docked for being late, for never having fed. You know, everybody gets a chance, right? And you may have a stay at home dad and the mom worked 40, 50 hours a week, but that doesn't mean she should be prevented from having time and parenting time with her children. So, and the reverse, obviously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right. And I imagine too, a lot of the issues could be marital. So whether they're the worst husband or the worst wife or they cheated or they did this, that's not necessarily the same thing as how they're going to be treated as a parent with the law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eAbsolutely. And I will say though that we do deal a lot, I do deal a lot with a parent, sometimes parents, plural, but typically one parent may have addiction issues. And that brings a whole another level of concern and of course safety concerns about the child or the children. And so we do typically address those in another format, but that is a factor that the judge will consider is like an addiction issue. And what has the addictive parent done, right? To prove themselves, to follow safety protocols and that type of thing. So, you there are parents who do are justifiably, they're justified in their concern about the safety of their children. And we put safety factors in play and there's many ways to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, one of our sponsors is Sober Link and we're always introducing that to people how like, because alcohol is a very common issue with custody and co-parenting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eAlcohol, drugs, there are other addictions that are not as prevalent, but even quite frankly, I just had a client that I got divorced. November will be a year and he called me last week. His wife is an alcoholic and had been before I got them divorced. She had been in and out of eight rehabs, eight. But we came up with a parenting plan that has strict protocol and when and how she can get her kids. Unfortunately in their stages, stage one stage phases state phase one two three unfortunately, she fell off the wagon. He found her passed out in her house with alcohol and all kinds of things around her. And so now we're getting ready - I'm actually Monday meeting with the Guardian ad litem in that case to decide like what do we do next? Luckily this guy isn't bitter and angry like a lot of people would be. And so he's trying to do it in a very fair and reasonable way for his ex-wife because she does look, it's a mental health medical issue when you have an addiction. So he luckily is actually approaching it in a very positive way, just like he did in the divorce. But sometimes we don't have that. he would have, other people would have filed an emergency motion to change custody prevent her from having any time and keep the kids in fairness, which he has a right to do, from even going to her until a judge weighs in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: How much weight do courts give to a child's own wishes about where they want to live?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eGreat question. So in Georgia, when a child turns 14, they have a right to elect which parent they want to live with. The election is a presumption unless the other party can prove that the parent they're electing to live with is unfit. So the judge is gonna put a lot of weight on where they want to live, assuming there's not an issue with fitness, but that doesn't mean the child can choose what the schedule should be. And I think a lot of people get that confused because they think that if the kid can elect who they live with, they get to elect when they see the other parent. And that's just not true. In fact, it's the opposite. There still will be a schedule in place. And the parent who has primary custody of that child, where the child elects to live, will need to facilitate the parenting plan, the time that that child should still be spending with the other parent. So the judge is gonna put a decent amount of weight on it unless the parent that's not being elected to live with can prove unfitness. And unfit is, again, a high bar, right? So they're probably going to, the election will prevail, but the physical time still needs to be determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the other interesting piece is, a child between 11 and 14 in Georgia, and it's pretty young, 11, but 11 to 14 can vocalize which parent they want to live with, but that's just sort of a vocalization, if you will. Many judges don't want to talk to children. So in that particular case, there might be a guardian ad litem appointed in the case, which is a third person appointed to represent the best interest of the children. The child may vocalize to the guardian ad litem, hey, I really wanna live with my mom and I really wanna live with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, makes sense. Right, 11, that is young to have that kind of decision-making power. For the parents listening that are fearing losing custody, what's one misconception that you see about how custody really works?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo it's like I said, mean, parents start out, it doesn't start with a mom or a dad has more leverage, if you will. Parents start out on equal footing. And then we look at if there's any concerns or issues, is there addiction? Is there domestic violence? Is there fill in the blank? So it could be a number of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas there one parent working so much to provide for the family that they just didn't have as much time with the kids? That didn't make them a bad parent. It doesn't make them unfit. And a lot of people may, and we see this so much in today's world, work really hard in their 20s and 30s and 40s because the goal is to retire early or have enough of a nest egg if they want to. So why should they be punished if they did that?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then decide, you now I'm getting divorced, but I want to spend time with my kids. I haven't really had that opportunity. So it's a misconception that you're just going to lose custody. You're not going to lose custody. you're, you know, you might not get the, be the primary custodial parent. You may not, you know, we have, we have areas of decision-making, health, education, religion, extracurricular activity. I call that the here acronym, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may only get religion when you've always been the one to pick the school or help with homework and not get education. So I think it's a misconception that people think they're just going to lose, even when you have bad facts on your side, whether it's alcoholism or drug addiction or sex addiction or gambling, because those are like the four big addiction areas I see a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou're not just losing and you may like my case that I just referenced, you may have a plan like what we call a step up plan where there's phases. And if you meet the requirements in phase one, you get to phase two and meet the requirements in phase two and so on. like in phase one, you may have to sober link four times a day, maybe get, you know, blood test or urine testing once a week or something of that nature. If you follow that and do everything for six months, you jump to phase two and it's less and less restriction. And as long as you're following the protocol and passing and doing all the things required of you, then you should get to, hopefully, if it's a decent parenting plan and both parents are good fit people, you get to some form of joint custody.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, and I imagine a lot of people's experience with this is contentious, they're soon to be ex saying you're never going to get the kid so they're coming at it. There's like a big knowledge gap. It's emotionally charged, and they don't really know what the law is. So a lot of people are coming in a fearful way, or they're like, are they going to take everything and it's you need to speak to an attorney and really figure out what the law is and what's what's real and what's just idle threats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThat's right. And what I see a lot under that kind of example that you're giving is the party making the threats has been doing what we call divorce planning. So they may have started six months earlier talking to lawyers, researching, talking to friends they know have gotten divorced. And that's what we call the divorce planning party in the case. And then you've got this other party who's hearing threats, completely caught off guard, right? Whether they should have been or not. mean, a lot of people are caught off guard, but they really did see the signs, right? If that makes sense. So the one feeling threatened because they're caught off guard, they just need to go meet with a lawyer, make sure it's someone well qualified, highly reputable, that knows what they're doing, that's done it for enough time where they can really advise you. And so even if you're the addict, the abuser, whatever it is, that lawyer should be able to help you understand what do I need to do in order to get the best result for my case. And that's hopefully gonna put that person's mind at ease a little bit, especially if they figured out, they usually figure out their spouse met with their lawyer, you know, six months or a year earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sometimes meet with clients once, twice, three times a year and nothing's ever filed. So people just wanna get information and I always tell those clients, knowledge is power. And so if you can have knowledge and understand the process, then you can at least be empowered with knowing what are you getting yourself into if you go down this path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The person that is kind of feeling like this came out of nowhere and now they're in a fight with this person, maybe they've met with a lawyer, maybe they haven't. Is there any scripts? putting you on the spot here. anything that you would say like while you're in that moment, just be like, I know saying less is more, I need to think about that or let me talk to an attorney. How do you advise clients to handle like that, that really those threats and that tension at home?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo, so pretty much by the what you're saying is they're now meeting with me and the other side is making these comments or threats and they're having to live under one roof, especially children. I always tell my clients do more listening than speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThat is very hard for people in these situations, right? Because they want to defend themselves. They want to defend or counter whatever the accusation or the threat is. But I say do more listening than speaking. I say document everything. You want to document everything. So you're now coexisting under one roof with these children who should be completely kept out of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not involve the kids. Do not tell the kids what's going on. And when they ask, you have to say to them, and this is hard for people, these are adult issues and the adults will handle it, right? And so I just, if the client will at least follow those two or three points of information, then they're starting out on the right foot. And then they can start to build their case. And they can go back and they can go see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWhat was going on six months ago that he would have gone or she would have gone to meet with this lawyer? And then they start putting their timeline together and it makes more sense and it empowers that person because they're like, now this makes sense, right?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's a great answer. And it was kind of going to be my last question is like if you could give somebody a piece of advice that is starting custody case, what would it be? It sounds like do more listening than speaking, document everything. Any other pieces of advice for somebody that's starting this process?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003eAnd start to build what I like to call the history of the marriage, incorporating, I always tell people start from either right before they got married or right after, but incorporating anything that could be relevant, whether it's a contested custody case or whether it's just about money, discussions about staying home, discussions about, you know, working part time, discussions about you know, who would be responsible for what? Do you have any evidence of that? Because once they start putting together what I call their history, they remember, my gosh, I think I have a whole text chain with the nanny where my spouse explained this is what we're looking for and this is why. Like, you'd be surprised at what will trigger your memory when you start to recap your history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so if you can start your history, look for your evidence, document everything, that is huge. And that's not just about the kids, but it's about the money as well, right? Because I know this isn't really about the money, but it's important. Then you're at least preparing yourself and empowering yourself and your lawyer for information that he or she's gonna need for advocating on your behalf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And I imagine besides logistically, it can be therapeutic to get it out of your head onto a piece of paper because, you know, our minds can just spin. And it sounds like good advice for many reasons to document.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCarla: \\u003c/strong\\u003e100%. And a lot of times if these cases get further along and they're being interviewed either by the guardian ad litem or the custody evaluator or if their take if their deposition is being taken, that history helps trigger and things to remember that they may not have.

Welcome to the DivorceLawyer.com Podcast. Today we are lucky to be joined by Max Emmer. Max is a family law attorney in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. After starting out in corporate litigation, Max shifted into family law to better serve his community. Outside of work, Max is a tennis and pickleball player, a diehard Detroit Lions fan, not a, not a hard fan to be right now and proud dad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eNo, it's a good time to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Proud dad to his son Rocky and his dog Hudson and today we're going to be talking about collaborative divorce versus traditional litigation, cost, time, outcomes, all that good stuff. Max, thank you for being here today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThanks so much, happy to be here. Appreciate the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I mean, a good day to be a Lions fan. You guys are just like...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eIt's funny, when I wrote that, it was probably when we were still horrible and I always had to add the preamble. Don't think I'm intellectually deficient by being a lion's man. Now I look like the smartest guy in the room. So I will take our Detroit lion victory lap while we can get it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I mean, what a fun team to be on. Let's talk about diving into you started your legal career in high stakes corporate litigation. What made you decide to pivot into family law?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo it's a great question and I've had a, you know, securities career route and I'm fortunate to have great opportunities. I started representing banks, financial advisories and institutions and securities litigation arbitration. And I traveled around the country and I learned a lot of great skills and work with great people. For me, I need that human element and I learned that within a few years and not to say that work is not important, it very much is. But for me, representing a company or kind of just doing deep dives on discovery a box of documents, that's not where my strengths or my interests or my skills lie. And over the course of working at a couple of firms over a few years, I really recognized that I needed to be working with people on people issues on a daily basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that, I kind of found a place in family law, which I was fortunate to do. And since then, I've really tried to create a niche where I provide other options for family law matters that aren't just knock down, drag out, toxic, traditional litigation. And I really try to educate people. There's more than one way to get divorced and there's more than one way to do things. And if you're at least educated in the options, you can make the best decision for both you and your family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Curious as somebody who's not a lawyer, what does that look? Obviously, you go to law school, you learn everything, you obviously have a natural just skill set and way of thinking. Is it like, I'm just going to pivot into family law and figure this out?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo for me, so it's a great question. For me, I was at a firm for four years and I just, it had run its course and I switched to another firm where I switched my practice area, I was doing some general litigation, I was doing some estate planning. And then when I was looking for new opportunity, I just, ended up talking to a family lawyer who said, given my personality and my entrepreneurial spirit and kind of my, what there is about me, if I was interested in family law, I could do it. Do it in my own way. And I think I also wanted a practice where I could eventually work for myself. I come from a family of entrepreneurs. No one in my family's really had bosses in 50 years. So I really wanted to also do something where I knew sooner than later I could make my own entry in with family law. That was a way to do it. And after working for a family lawyer for about a year and a half, I launched my own firm during COVID, where I really focus on collaborative divorce, family law mediation, and all sorts of family law matters, but really trying to make them as amicable and streamlined and direct and efficient as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You said the word collaborative divorce. I'm sure a lot of people have impressions of what divorce is like, war of the roses. What is collaborative divorce and how is it different?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, I don't know if anyone my age knows that, not that we're so different age, but I've seen it that's a great reference. So what I tell people is traditional litigation is what you see in the movies and TV edits. Someone files, they serve the other party at their kids' soccer game. There's a fight, they're in court for a year, they're doing subpoenas, they're doing interrogatories, they're doing depositions, they mediate four times, they either settle, they go to trial, and they end up with a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the old way of doing divorce, don't get me wrong, that is still very prevalent and common. However, I would say in the last decade, the idea of collaborative divorce or alternative divorce options have come into the ether. And when we talk about collaborative divorce specifically, there is a collaborative divorce bar, we're certified, we're trained. In Michigan, there's about 30 lawyers. And if you want a collaborative divorce, there's a few differences. Difference one is the case is done in complete opposite.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe only file your case once we've settled it. So if you want to do a collaborative divorce, Jane hires me as her collaborative lawyer. If John, her husband, is in agreement, he would hire a collaborative lawyer. We hire a certified divorce financial analyst. We hire a mental health professional who helps co-parenting family issues. And then really, through private meetings and mediation, we work through your divorce privately and before filing. And then and only then we file. There's a lot of benefits to that, privacy, costs, creativity, and you are really able to opt out of the system, if you will. Obviously, if there's certain circumstances, you don't, but we're able to take a process that's normally six to 12 months, and we can turn it into a several month process. And I think whether it's the privacy, I think whether it's the ability to not be on the court's deadline and orders, I think there's a lot of attraction to people for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then kind of under that umbrella, I do a lot of what I call one lawyer divorce, which is where I don't ethically represent two parties, but let's say two people agree on most everything. One of them might hire me. I prepare all the documents and paperwork for their review. The other person has their opportunity if they want to review with their own lawyer, and then I help effectuate it. So whether it's pre-mediation or pre-filing negotiation, collaborative divorce, there's a bunch of ways we can handle your divorce that save time, save money. Also save emotional capital and don't put you in the system that tends to be overly difficult and overly emotional and overly cumbersome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So if somebody is listening right now and they say, this sounds like a great setup, but I don't know if my husband or wife who's much more contentious about this, if they would agree on it, who is collaborative divorce a fit for and who is it not a fit for?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo that's a great question. I think one thing that sets me apart is I'm very careful. I don't push people into collaborative if I don't think they're a fit and vice versa. The people who are a fit for collaborative, I would say, are people who genuinely want to do what's best for their family despite their feelings or misgivings about their soon to be ex. I think it's people who understand the holistic and comprehensive approach that this touches every part of their life. And I think it's people who almost want some catharsis. And I'm not saying it needs to be, you know, crystals and things like that. But for people who just say, hey, look, this is happening. I might be happy about it. I might not be. But it's happening. And I want to do what's best for my family and my kids and me. And I'd like to have a team. I'd like to have a supportive and private place to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people who it's not for, look, if you have a very contentious custody battle, if you don't agree who should be the primary parent or custodial or parenting time, if you think someone is really hiding money or deceiving you, those aren't typically the best fits for collaborative due to the out-of-court nature. But in speaking with someone like me or a similarly minded professional, we're usually pretty good at tailoring who and what are a fit and what aren't. But that being said, just because you two aren't the hunky-doryest, most friendly, soon-to-be exes alive, that doesn't mean you can't do collaborative. I would say, as long as there's some level of mutual respect, or at least understanding that this is happening and you both want to do what's right for you, your kids, and your family, I think that can be a really good fit for a collaborative or a collaborative-like method.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What if, I'm sure this is not the first time it's happened, I call Max, I say, Max, you're my guy, and maybe my soon-to-be ex hires a shark. Is that now?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThat tends to happen. I pride myself. I work pretty well with all kinds of lawyers. I have cases with the really difficult pit bulls and lawyers like me. One thing I do that I think separates me is that I'm really honest and transparent with my clients. If I have a client who hires me for collaborative and their spouse goes out and hires a quote unquote killer and they want to make it a bloodbath, I will say to my client, look, I can handle this. I'm good at this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I also want you to feel comfortable as you're responsible. If you have any questions or thoughts that you want to supplement counsel or even up or level up in that way, I want you to be best positioned. And whether that, I sometimes serve as co-counsel. So it tends to happen. But even with difficult lawyers, I've done collaborative cases. Now, those cases tend to still be in the court system, they still can be amicable in that we're not doing a ton of motions and a ton of discovery. And it doesn't go through the collaborative process formally, but we handle it in an amicable manner. And I think as a lawyer like myself who really tries to be flexible and really tries to curate a plan and a case process on an individualized basis, I really try to tailor everything to both my client as well as the realities on the other side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So people going in, we learn about the different types of divorce. You have litigation, have contested, uncontested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, so I would say traditional litigation, would say, is in court, more contentious. I would say collaborative divorce in the official process, kind of the other end. And then I do a lot of one lawyer divorce or kind of like a pre-filing negotiation, which I would call collaborative light, where you might not hire the whole team, but you each have a lawyer and you're going to negotiate. I also serve as a mediator, pre-filing. So the biggest thing I try to emphasize to people, and I think educating people on their options is really important.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's more than one way to do this and you deserve a 15 or 20 minute conversation about the different options available to you so you can be fully informed to make the best decision for yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What's the biggest misconception people have about collaborative divorce?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThat's a great question. I think there's probably two intertwined misconceptions. I would say one is that just because you're doing it collaboratively means your lawyer is going to be soft or weak or ineffectual, and that's not the case. As I say, I can wield the sword, but I think most of the time the sword need not be wielded. And that's very counterintuitive to most family lawyers. So I would say that there is this maybe presumption of weakness or softness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the other thing I would say is that you can't zealously advocate for yourself or have your lawyers zealously advocate for you if it's collaborative. And that's not true either. In my collaborative cases and sessions, I fiercely and strongly put forward my clients' positions and their point of view and context. But I just don't do it in a way that is overly inflammatory. I don't do it in a way that turns a $12,000 divorce into a $68,000 divorce. And so the messaging and the substance is very similar. It's more the style that changes. And I believe most cases are better served with a lawyer who serves more like a statesman. Are there times where you need a killer, you need a pit bull, or you need the lawyer who's going to slam the table and all that? Sure. But I think someone who gives you good, sound, thoughtful advice, and a lawyer who makes you feel heard and valued, that will best serve you in this process.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Is it, let's say somebody is working with a lawyer and they are not really, it's not really the fit that they thought. Maybe they got sold something and now they're running up their retainer. Is it too late for them to make a change?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eSo people change lawyers all the time. I like to say people come to me kind of for a second opinion sometimes and I don't directly impugn or criticize what another lawyer does or doesn't do. But I think sometimes, especially with divorce where there is a time element or there is an emotional element, sometimes people make a decision, you're allowed to have the counsel of your choice. If you are working with someone and you don't feel heard or you don't think they're treating your case or you with the respect and attention it needs, you absolutely have the right to seek out counsel of your choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have remaining retainer left, you can get a refund of that. If it's expired, you can always change counsel, which I know is not easy. I know people don't necessarily want to do, but better sooner than later because it's a lot easier to make a change a couple weeks in or two months in than it is seven months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So if somebody's listening right now, they've been thinking about divorce for a long time. We talk a lot about like consultations, making the most of it on that call that they have with you. What is like one question that you would advise, even if it's not to you that they really asked this lawyer about?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, I mean, I think that's a great question and I could go in a number of directions. I think less a specific question and more something I would look for as a client is really try and get an understanding of the lawyer's philosophy and approach to their practice in family law. Because if you have a lawyer who just says, you have to hire me today, you have to give me a $15,000 retainer, we're gonna file this complaint, all these ex-parte orders. We're going to serve them at your kids' gymnastic tournament. We're going do this. If you want or need that, great.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as a potential client, I would like a lawyer who's a bit more consultative, who's a bit more thoughtful and a bit more strategic. So I would be asking, what sorts of cases do you handle? Do you only do traditional litigation? What is your typical expectation for a case timeline and proceeding? And basic questions like that I think will illuminate the type of lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing too, I am a true solo. I answer my phone and my email. And I think a lot of people appreciate that level of client service. And I'm not saying every lawyer can't do that. And I'm unique in that. But trust your instinct. And if you reach out to an office and you feel pushed off or you don't feel like you're a priority, that is truthful to you. And that is impactful. And you should listen to that. And I think sometimes people just take the first referral or take the first name they see. And oftentimes that person can be very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut listen to your gut instinct. And if it's not a fit or if you have questions, talk to someone else. Personally, my potential clients are always shocked when I encourage them to talk to other people. And maybe they think it's like a reverse sales tactic. But I'm like, look, this is your life. And this is a big decision. And who am I to try and strong arm you to doing this. And I guess one point I'd make, not so much a question, one thing I'd look out for, if you are in a situation where there's domestic violence, if you're in a situation where there is potential parental kidnapping or someone is hiding money or kicking you out of your house, those are emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a normal divorce and there's no exigent circumstance, the lawyer who's pressuring you to sign and retain like a car salesman is not who I would go with because again, and I tell most people this, absent an emergency, you don't need to file today, you don't need to file tomorrow, you could file next week. And I always tell people, you're in enough stress and you have enough anxiety as it is, you don't need me to add to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Very refreshing to hear and it's very helpful because I think like, you know, you get married, this is maybe the person you've been with for 20 plus years. So you're used to like, all right, this is the first divorce lawyer I'm talking to, let me marry them. And a lot of times like, this is a time not to make that mistake again. This is a time to date around a little and figure out what is the right fit for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMax: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYou know, 100%. And for me, anyone who reached out to me, I give a free initial consult that's usually 20 to 30 minutes. I also offer kind of what I call a detailed consultation strategy session, which for reduced hourly rate, I provide an in-depth 60 or 90 minute consult. And I can say I've had a lot of clients who are either on the fence about the process or want more information. And in probably doing 50 of those, I can honestly say I've never had a client think it wasn't worth the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think it really gives you an opportunity to one, see the lawyer, hear about them, their style, run potential numbers, game out scenarios, put a roadmap together. And for the people I work with, I think they find that both refreshing and reassuring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRob\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Refreshing. That's something I would take away from this conversation. Max, learned a ton. Thank you so much for being on the DivorceLawyer.com Podcast.

Erin Levine is a lawyer turned legal innovator and the founder of Hello Divorce. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://hellodivorce.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eHelloDivorce.com\\u003c/a\\u003e, an award-winning online platform that's changing people's experience of how they divorce. A certified family law specialist and longtime attorney, Erin saw firsthand how the system often made things harder and set out to build something better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough Hello Divorce, she's helped thousands of people navigate divorce with clarity, confidence, and peace of mind. Her work has been recognized by the American Bar Association, Duke's Law Legal Tech Accelerator, TechCrunch, Forbes, and Fast Company, which named Hello Divorce one of the most innovative companies in social impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood morning, Erin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eGood morning. Thanks for having me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: It's great to have you here. So we've all seen that smiling couples and conscious uncoupling headlines, but the truth is, let me start that over.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday's topic is the dirty secret about amicable divorce that no one wants to admit. We've all seen the smiling couples, the conscious uncoupling headlines. The truth is amicable doesn't mean easy and it definitely doesn't mean you agree on everything from the start. After helping over 15,000 couples navigate divorce without court, Erin has learned the real piece takes structure, transparency and accountability, not just good vibes. In this episode, we can unpack what a truly amicable divorce looks like. It's still grueling. Why the system often sets us up to fail and how to protect your sanity, savings and kids in the process. It's raw. It's relatable. And Erin thinks it will change how listeners think about divorce, whether they're in it, avoiding it or just trying to do it better.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let's just jump into it. What do you, what do we and what do you mean by that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWell, I think when most people think of that conscious uncoupling that Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin had now over a decade ago with smiles and hugs and maybe a high five outside the courthouse. And while there certainly are divorces where the couples become best friends or maybe really truly both wanted the divorce and can evolve into something different, the vast majority of us don't have a divorce like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the problem with portraying an amicable or an out of court divorce like that is that it makes people think they fall into one of two categories, either the perfect super evolved divorce or the lawyer up in fight, never ending, wildly expensive, messy divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Do you find that most people will approach an attorney trying to label what they feel is an amicable divorce or does the attorney more take the lead for how they feel it's going to go based upon what their prospect tells them?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin:\\u003c/strong\\u003e In my experience, and you were very kind to say that I had been a divorce lawyer for a long time, I've actually been doing it 20 years, which is sometimes really hard to admit. In my experience, both as a divorce lawyer and as the founder and CEO of Hello Divorce, most people don't want a long, messy, wildly expensive divorce. Most people come to us with the hope that they can do this quietly and kindly and not spend their entire life savings on divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is, that the system in many ways sets us up to fight and that many lawyers, so this is why it's so important to choose the right lawyer that you work with, prove their value by winning. It's not that they necessarily want it to be a knockout, drag out fight. It's that we are taught as lawyers that the better the result, the better that we do in court, the more fights that we win, the better and happier the client will feel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: A very interesting point, scary point. So you've helped over 15,000 couples divorce without going to court. When people say amicable divorce, what do they think it means versus what it really looks like?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yeah, I think they think amicable divorce means conflict free. And the way I like to think about it is this conflict managed, right? For most people, most people, actually, I can't remember the last divorce I saw and we see thousands on our platform where there wasn't some element of conflict. In fact, most people come into their divorce not knowing if they'll be able to reach an agreement at all. And yet you can still label your divorce amicable if the goal is to stay out of court.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the goal is to work either together or with settlement-minded lawyers or with a mediator to try to come to a resolution that doesn't burn it all down.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I think the biggest myth is that amicable means effortless and that if it somehow gets hard, you've failed. But in reality, amicable divorce is often the hardest emotional work you'll ever do because you're grieving, you're learning, you're making these big life changing decisions and you're negotiating with the same person who may have broken your heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is so important that we think about having an amicable or an out of court divorce. And I know understand it doesn't work for everyone, although I do believe it works for most because we are setting ourselves up through divorce for a solid foundation for our next chapter. And if we're thinking about everything that went wrong in our relationship and all the ways we can get back at our spouse, versus how can we best set ourselves up and our kids for our next chapter, then we're doing ourselves and our families a huge disservice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's a huge point. yeah, human nature is to take the path of least resistance. So when seeing a word like amicable, it's like, sure, I'd like to head in that direction and I will choose that, but that's not really what it's about on its face, certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWe know we have to remind ourselves that amicable doesn't mean you don't fight. We've got to rebrand amicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to rebrand amicable into a word that's it doesn't mean you don't fight. It means you know when to stop. It means that you have your priorities in check. It means that you have determined what your most important goals are, your must haves, your needs to have. And you let a lot of the other stuff go so that you can have your divorce be three months or six months or nine months instead of years and cost a few thousand dollars instead of your entire life savings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What I really appreciate about that is that we have dozens of people on our podcast every single month and their main goal is to promote their business, which is important. But what you're actually doing, and I know you and I know your reputation is actually, is really asking somebody to ask the important questions, be introspective and sort of let them know where this can all go if they ask the right questions to begin with. Very, very valuable stuff. Sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, I want, sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. Yeah, I want people to take a step back before they start the divorce because what I've seen and what I saw a lot of in my law practice is that as everybody knows, divorce brings up so much emotion. And if we lead our divorce with that emotion, that overwhelm, that fear, that anger, the grief, and we make choices from a place of anger or resentment or fear, those are not going to be good choices for our lives, right? Nothing good ever comes from making choices from a place of fear instead of self-knowingness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what I want people to think about and one of the big reasons why I say, let's talk about amicable, let's talk about what divorce can look like, because I don't want people to just hand their divorce over to one of us, one of our professionals and say, have a good time. It is so important to think about what it is that we want out of this. And there are different ways to do it. It doesn't just have to be hire the most aggressive lawyer and see what happens kind of a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So to that end, what would you say is the biggest myth you'd love to bust about amicable divorce right off the bat? Is there something that jumps out at you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eI think the biggest myth is that it's effort, you know, that amicable divorce means effortless. And it's going to be challenging. It is going to be really, really hard. You are navigating out of a relationship that is probably years, if not decades long, and that's not going to happen every night. And this, excuse me, that's not going to happen overnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And you've said amicable divorce doesn't mean easy several times. Can you share a story or is there an example that captures how emotionally grueling it can still be?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eYeah, I mean, one of the things that we do a lot on our platform is mediation. So I'm sure you will have or have had a mediator or lawyer mediator on your platform, on your podcast, but a mediator is a neutral third party, often a lawyer, but not always, who helps couples untangle their marriage and their finances and all of that kind of stuff so that they can come to an agreement and move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was mediating a divorce where one couple came in and they thought they were totally aligned. They came in and they agreed on parenting. They knew they were going to share parenting. They knew what the schedule would look like. They even knew who would pick up for extracurricular activities and who would go to like the baseball tournaments and who would even bring the snacks. They knew what they would do with the house. And the one thing they didn't talk about were the retirement accounts. And suddenly it wasn't just about numbers. it became about years of resentment. So he felt that he had earned every single dollar and that that was his. And he was willing to share something, but he definitely didn't think it should be split. And she felt that she would sacrifice, she had sacrificed her career so that he could have his and that she, regardless of what the law says, they were in a community property state. So it's divided 50-50.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can't come to an agreement. And I think they both knew that. And yet the mediation took a turn where the entire focus became about resentment and anger and a lot of feelings instead of the actual numbers. Like they both wanted to be heard. So we had to really slow it down and clarify, of course, what's actually marital property and help them see what post-divorce life would look like financially. But we couldn't do that until we addressed the fear and the anger head on. And they still disagreed. But they left with an agreement that felt reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that's the thing about amicable divorce, right? It's not the absence of conflict. There will be conflict. It's the ability to come back to the table after conflict and get it done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You've mentioned that the system sets couples up to fail. What do you mean by that? And how does the traditional divorce process make amicably harder?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eI want people to really listen to this piece because it took me decades to truly understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't care how well intentioned your divorce lawyer is. The system sets us up to fight and we have to fight in our own way tooth and nail to keep from, you know, making this a super messy divorce. So the traditional system is adversarial by design, even when you and your spouse aren't. So if you've ever seen the movie, The Marriage Story, those two people came in with good intentions. Their goal was not to ramp things up and make it messy. But if you've seen it, you know that's exactly what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first document that you file in almost every state says spouse A versus spouse B right there. You're looking at the document and there's a versus, right? There's, sets this up to think about this as a fight on that same document. It says you are being sued. And at the same time, you are receiving these documents by virtue of usually it's a random stranger process server who shows up at your work or at your home in front of your kids and you are immediately positioned as opponents. You're immediately triggered. It's like that fight or flight feeling, right? Then on top of that, every motion, every delay, every email, it's all billable and the system, it profits from conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you've got this language, like you've been served X versus Y, opposing counsel, and that keeps you in fight mode. I think most families today, they don't want to destroy each other. They want to clarify, they want closure, they want to protect their kids. But the process, everything from the language to how we assert our rights, it pushes people towards war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I'm going to go out on a limb here and just say that of all the podcasts that we have ever done that by far was just the greatest gem for those listening. It really, really sets a tone from the very beginning that puts someone back on their heels. And so again, I hope people are really listening to that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: A huge jump. Thank you for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eThank you so much. And I don't want people to think I'm anti-lawyer. Like I am a lawyer. I have lawyers on our platform. I clearly, you know, love speaking with you and I wanted to be on this podcast. Lawyers are very important to the process, but it's also really important for us to understand the mindset of most lawyers and how it might differ with your goals and what you want to see happen and come out of this divorce experience because you have so much more control than you think you do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: After all the couples you've helped, the thousands of couples you've helped, what is the one thing you wish that every divorcing person knew before they started the process? And you may have just answered that question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin: \\u003c/strong\\u003eWell, yes, but I think it's important to remind people that it's okay to slow down. You might feel a lot of pressure. Usually what happens is you have one spouse who feels like it's moving too slow and the other spouse who is on the steep learning curve because they're maybe looking at finances for the first time in, you decades and they feel like it's moving too fast. But if you are that person who either feels like it's moving too fast for whatever reason, it's okay to slow down. Your nervous system is going to tell you that every email, every document, every message is a five alarms fire. It will. And if you've know anyone who's been divorced and they've been through this process, you know exactly what I'm talking about because you get that text from a friend that says, he said this or she said that. What do I do? my gosh, it's the end of the world. That is so normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is 100 % normal. It feels awful. Your entire livelihood feels like it's at stake. And to a large extent, a lot of things are. So I want to remind you, you have time to make smart strategic decisions. First, you need to get clear on your goals and know your top three priorities. What matters most to you and what you're willing to compromise on. The other thing I will say, and I know you asked for one thing, but I'm going to give you one more, which is get a basic understanding of your state's laws before you even talk to a lawyer or before, yeah, before you even talk to a lawyer. In fact, that's a really great place for you to start. can come to hellodivorce.com, get a basic understanding of what the state laws are, how the state looks at your finances, and then you can build from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people who end up with the best outcomes aren't the ones who avoid conflict. They're the ones who stay informed and stay grounded and give themselves a lot of grace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And really deal with things head on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Yes, yeah, yeah, even when they don't want to. But that doesn't mean you can't say, today is not a good day for me. I am not going to deal with a divorce today. That's okay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Got it. Great. And what's the dirty secret you want listeners to walk away remembering about amicable divorce?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eErin:\\u003c/strong\\u003e I want people to remember that it doesn't mean easy. It means intentional. And it's still going to be emotional. It's still going to be messy. There are still going to be moments that test your patience. But with the right process and support, for most people, amicable, meaning an out of court divorce is possible and it is worth it because it is going to protect the most valuable things you have left, your privacy, your sanity, your savings and your ability to co-parent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDevon\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Gotcha.

Beyond the emotional toll, alcohol misuse causes legal, safety, and trust concerns that can complicate custody arrangements. The divorce often involves questions about how to protect children and improve peace of mind during parenting time.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eFor anyone wondering ‘How do you know when it’s time to divorce an alcoholic?’, everyone’s situation is unique, and professionals can help with decision-making. For many, though, the choice usually comes when drinking begins to affect safety, reliability, and emotional stability within the household. While emotionally taxing, divorce can be a necessary step toward protecting children and creating a stable home life where everyone can thrive.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ci\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e(Disclaimer: The term “alcoholic” is used throughout this article because it remains widely recognized by readers and searchers.

Courts also evaluate each parent’s ability to provide a safe and stable home. Verified proof of sobriety or evidence of relapse can heavily influence custody arrangements designed to protect the child’s well-being.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eMany parents facing this situation ask, ‘\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/family-law-blog/national-child-safety-awareness-legal-strategies-to-prove-an-unsafe-environment-for-a-child\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eHow do you prove an unsafe environment for a child?\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e’ In family court, the answer lies in documentation. Judges rely on consistent, verifiable evidence that shows whether alcohol use has compromised safe parenting.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat’s why alcohol monitoring technology like \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.soberlink.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSoberlink\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e has become so valuable in custody cases involving alcohol. For more than a decade, Soberlink has been the most trusted system for proving sobriety. Its court-admissible data helps judges make informed decisions about custody and visitation while promoting transparency and accountability for everyone involved.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eWhy Alcohol Monitoring Matters in Custody Cases\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eFamily courts place a strong emphasis on child safety and accountability. Allegations about alcohol misuse can turn into costly, drawn-out disputes without objective evidence. Monitoring with advanced tools can protect both the child and the parent by creating a transparent record of sobriety.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIf you’re divorcing an alcoholic with children, exploring Soberlink should be your next consideration. The system is specifically designed to help families where alcohol misuse has caused mistrust or fear. It offers remote monitoring with key features like facial recognition to confirm identity during each test and tamper detection to prevent cheating, both of which are essential for proving sobriety in custody cases.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eHow Soberlink Supports Co-Parenting and Accountability\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDivorce doesn’t end parenting responsibilities. In shared custody situations where one parent is misusing alcohol, alcohol monitoring can mitigate conflict and protect children from unpredictable environments. Many families have found that using Soberlink during and after divorce protects children while strengthening trust and communication.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e“Soberlink is a great thing to add as an extra layer of security and just makes it easier to co-parent with someone who is an alcoholic.” – Andrea\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIn high-conflict situations, where accusations about drinking can quickly escalate or result in revoked parenting time, having a system in place that provides real-time results is critical. Soberlink automatically sends verified test results to designated contacts, fostering transparency and empowering both parents by providing objective evidence that supports fair custody arrangements.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e“Soberlink’s anti-cheat features gave me a lot of peace of mind that we could go by what the results said, regardless of what he said was happening.” – Anna\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThis transparency helps reduce emotional tension and gives children a sense of security, knowing both parents are doing their part to create a stable environment and healthier dynamics. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eProtecting Children During and After Divorce\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eProtecting the well-being of the children is always the priority in any separation. Courts want to see that both parents are taking steps to ensure the child’s physical and emotional safety. When alcohol is involved, a monitoring program can demonstrate responsibility and show the court that a parent is committed to sobriety and to their child’s best interests.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e“Soberlink made me feel like I was actually getting the support outside of the walls of the court.” – Jim\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat feeling of continued support matters. Divorce proceedings often end before a parent’s recovery journey does. Soberlink bridges that gap by providing structure and accountability beyond the courtroom. Unlike traditional alcohol testing methods that require frequent lab visits, Soberlink’s discreet and portable devices allow parents to test from home or on the go. This convenience not only reduces stress but also gives parents more time to spend with their children - time that can be used to rebuild relationships and create new memories.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eIt’s also a tool that benefits both sides. For the parent with the alcohol misuse allegations, it offers a chance to rebuild trust and show consistency. For the concerned party, it provides peace of mind that their children are safe.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e“Soberlink is an investment in the kid’s future. It’s an investment in their safety, and it’s also an investment for the addict. This is giving them hard evidence for a judge to make a decision regarding a custody case.” – Jenna\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eThe Role of Accountability in Recovery and Custody\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAccountability is often the missing piece when alcohol misuse leads to custody issues. Courts need more than promises; they need data in a clear and easy-to-read format - exactly what Soberlink’s Advanced Reporting provides, which is useful for both the courts and the parent testing.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003e“Soberlink was that constant reminder of, ‘Hey, in four or five hours, I have to blow.’ Just that constant accountability is what really hit it home with me. One or two beers, then I’m losing custody of my children. It’s not worth it.” – Phil\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eThat mindset is what makes monitoring successful. It creates a tangible sense of responsibility and gives the court measurable proof of progress.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eFor many, Soberlink becomes part of a larger sobriety plan, reinforcing healthy habits and helping maintain structure during one of life’s most stressful transitions.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eLegal Benefits of Using Soberlink in Custody Cases\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAttorneys and judges appreciate evidence that is accurate, automated, and secure. Soberlink provides a digital record of every test, including date, time, facial recognition verification, and results. This eliminates the “he said, she said” arguments that often dominate family law cases involving alcohol.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eDocumentation can be the difference between limited and shared custody in cases that involve alcohol. Consistent monitoring shows that a parent is serious about recovery and willing to be transparent. It can also protect against false allegations of misusing alcohol, giving the court verifiable proof of sobriety.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eSystems like Soberlink help families move forward with less conflict and greater confidence in the outcome.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eRebuilding Trust and Moving Forward\\u003c/b\\u003e\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eAfter divorce, it takes time for all family members to adjust. Rebuilding trust requires consistent action, and accountability tools can play a major role in that process.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eParents who use Soberlink often say the structure helped them regain a sense of control over their lives while maintaining relationships with their children and demonstrating their commitment to their safety. \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-weight: 400;\\u0022\\u003eMonitoring doesn’t have to be punitive. When used with the right intentions, it can create a foundation of trust that benefits both parents. Soberlink empowers families by turning accountability into an opportunity for healing.
